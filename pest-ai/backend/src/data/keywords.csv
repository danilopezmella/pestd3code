The resulting observation ensemble is saved in a CSV file named case.obs.csv; the parameter ensemble is saved in a CSV file named case.par.csv.,
save_binary,Boolean,,A flag to save parameter and observation ensembles in binary format. If this is set to true parameter and observation ensembles are saved in files named case.par.jcb and case.obs.jcb.,
tie_by_group,Boolean,,Flag to tie all adjustable parameters by group designation; however all user-supplied parameter tied-parent relationships are preserved. The effective number of adjustable parameters thus becomes the number of parameter groups (which contain at least one adjustable parameter) plus the number of parameters that are listed as having others tied to it.,
iteration_summary,Boolean,,This flag activates or deactivates the writing of CSV files summarizing parameters (case.ipar) objective functions (case.iobj) sensitivities (case.isen) trial parameter upgrades (case.upg.csv) and parameter-to-run-id mapping (case.rid).,
der_forgive,Boolean,,If set to true then if model run failure occurs when calculating finite-difference derivatives with respect to a certain parameter that parameter is frozen at its current value for the remainder of the iteration. If set to false PESTPP-GLM terminates execution with an appropriate message if this occurs.,
enforce_tied_bounds,Boolean,,Flag to enforce parameter bounds on any tied parameters.,
glm_accept_mc_phi,Boolean,,Flag to accept FOSM-based realization phi each base iteration if the phi is lower than the lambda-testing phi. Default is false.,
rand_seed,unsigned integer,,Seed for the random number generator. Used for FOSM-based Monte Carlo.,
glm_rebase_super,Boolean,,"A flag to run the super-parameter truncated values once at the start of the first super parameter iteration to provide a more accurate ""base"" run for calculating sensitivity numerators. Only applies if n_iter_base = -1 and base_jacobian is supplied. Default is False which indicates use either the hotstart_resfile residuals or the base run previously completed.",
glm_iter_mc,Boolean,,Flag to undertake FOSM-based posterior Monte Carlo during each iteration of PESTPP-GLM. Default is False which will result in Monte Carlo only after iterations are done (depending on the glm_num_reals and uncertainty flags).,
ensemble_output_precision,int,,Number of significant digits to use in ASCII format ensemble files. Default is 6.,
glm_norm_form,String,,"The form of the normal matrix to use. Can be ""ident"" (identity matrix lambda scaling) ""diag"" (use the diagonal of XtQX for lambda scaling) or ""prior"" (scale with the inverse of the prior parameter covariance matrix). Default is ""diag.""",
MAX_RUN_FAIL,Integer,greater than 0; default is 3,Maximum times the run manager will try to rerun a failed run,
LAMBDAS,Comma-separated list of reals,greater than 0; default is (0.01 1 10 100 1000),Specify the standard values of lambda to be used each iteration,
ITERATION_SUMMARY,Boolean,“TRUE” or “FALSE”; default is “TRUE”,Setting this to “TRUE” will save a summary of each iteration to a series of comma-separated files for easy plotting,
DER_FORGIVE,Boolean,“TRUE” or “FALSE”; default is “TRUE”,Setting this to “FALSE” will turn off derivative forgive and cause PEST++ to terminate if a run fails while computing the Jacobian,
PARAMETER_COVARIANCE,Text,Filename; default is none,The name of a PEST-compatible ASCII matrix or uncertainty file to use as the prior parameter covariance matrix,
OVERDUE_RESCHED_FAC,Real,greater than 1.0; default is 1.15,YAMR specific command. If model run takes longer than (OVERDUE_RESCHED_FAC * the average runtime) it will be rescheduled on another node if one is available,
OVERDUE_GIVEUP_FAC,Real,greater than 1.0; default is 100.0,YAMR specific command. If a model run has been running longer than (OVERDUE_GIVEUP_FAC * the average runtime) it will be canceled,
N_ITER_BASE,Integer,1 or greater,Number of base parameter iterations performed for each superparameter iteration,
N_ITER_SUPER,Integer,0 or greater,Number of superparameter iterations performed for each base parameter iteration,
SUPER_EIGTHRES,Real,any positive number (typically should be greater than 1.0E−7),PEST++ will not include any superparameters whose ratio with the largest superparameter is less than this ratio,
MAX_N_SUPER,Integer,integer between 1 and the minimum either of maximum number of parameters or the maximum number of observations,Maximum number of superparameters to use in the superparameter iterations,
MAX_REG_ITER,Integer,integer greater than 1; default is 20,Provides a limit on the maximum number of iterations used to compute dynamic regularization weights when PEST++ is run in regularization mode,
MAX_SUPER_FRZ_ITER,Integer,1 or greater; default value is 5,Maximum number of times a superparameter iteration will try to freeze any parameters that go out of bounds and try to recompute a Jacobian,
AUTO_NORM,Integer,1 or greater; default is no scaling,Automatically normalizes the sensitivities by assuming there are X standard deviations between the upper and lower parameter bounds,
SVD_PACK,String,“JACOBI” or “PROPACK”; default is “JACOBI”,Flag to use PROPACK to compute SVD factorizations. “JACOBI” is the SVD provided by the EIGEN library; “PROPACK” is the iterative SVD factorization suitable for large problems,
MAT_INV,String,“Q1/2J” or “JTQJ”; default is “JTQJ”,Flag to specify the formulation of the normal equation. This option is forced to “Q1/2J” when PROPACK is used,
SUPER_RELPARMAX,Real,greater than 0; default is 0.1,Parameter relative change limit for superparameters,
