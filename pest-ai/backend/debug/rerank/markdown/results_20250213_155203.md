### Summary
**DERZEROLIM (optional) defines a Jacobian matrix zero threshold for compressed storage. NTPLFLE is the number of template files; NINSFLE is the number of instruction files. PRECIS ("single" or "double") sets precision. DPOINT ("point" or "nopoint") controls decimal point inclusion. NUMCOM, JACFILE, MESSFILE (Chapter 12) handle model-calculated derivatives. OBSREREF (Chapter 14) activates observation re-referencing.**

### Header
**4.2.5 Fourth Line**

### Content
DERZEROLIM
Like MAXCOMPDIM, DERZEROLIM is optional. If supplied, it supports the use of MAXCOMPDIM, defining a threshold below which the value of an element of the Jacobian matrix can be considered to be zero, and hence omitted from compressed storage.
NTPLFLE
This is an integer variable, informing PEST of the number of model input files which contain parameters; PEST must write each of these files prior to a model run. As there must be one template file for each such model input file, NTPLFLE is also equal to the number of template files which PEST must use in writing the current parameter set. A model may have many input files; however PEST is concerned only with those which it needs to rewrite prior to each model run, i.e. those for which there are template files. As explained later, a single template file may, under some circumstances, be used to write more than one model input file. In such a case you must count each template file - model input file pair separately in determining NTPLFLE.
NINSFLE
This is the number of instruction files. There must be one instruction file for each model output file containing model-generated observations which PEST reads. (In some circumstances, a single model output file may be read by more than one instruction file; however each instruction file - model output file pair is counted separately in determining NINSFLE).
PRECIS
PRECIS is a character variable which must be either “single” or “double”. If it is supplied to PEST as “single”, PEST writes parameters to model input files using single precision protocol; hence parameter values will never be greater than 13 characters in length (even if the parameter space allows for a greater length) and the exponentiation character is “e”. If PRECIS is supplied as “double”, parameter values are written to model input files using double precision protocol; the maximum parameter value length is 23 characters and the exponentiation symbol is “d”. See section 2.2.6.
DPOINT
This character variable must be either “point” or “nopoint”. If DPOINT is provided with the value “nopoint” PEST will omit the decimal point from representations of parameter values on model input files if the decimal point is redundant, thus making room for the use of one extra significant figure. If DPOINT is supplied as “point” (which is normally recommended), PEST will ensure that the decimal point is always present. See section 2.2.6.
NUMCOM, JACFILE and MESSFILE
These variables are used to control the manner in which PEST can obtain derivatives directly from the model if these are available; see chapter 12. For normal operation these should be set to 1, 0 and 0 respectively. Alternatively, all of them can be omitted. However if one of
them is cited in the PEST control file then all of them must be cited. Also if a value is supplied for NUMCOM, then a DERCOM value must be supplied for all parameters in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file; If NUMCOM is 1, then all of these DERCOMs must also be 1.
OBSREREF
Observation re-referencing is activated by adding the string “obsreref” to the fourth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. The “obsreref” string can be placed anywhere on this line. Observation re-referencing can be de-activated (the default condition) by omitting this string, or by placing the string “noobsreref” on this line. Observation re-referencing is discussed in chapter 14 of this manual.

### Summary
**PESTGEN uses default names ("model", model.inp, model.tpl, model.out, model.ins); change these as needed, updating NTPLFLE and NINSFLE if necessary.  Verify the final control file using PESTCHEK before running PEST.  Other PESTGEN defaults (Figure 4.1) may require modification.**

### Header
**4.2 PESTGEN**

### Content
- PESTGEN assumes that the model is run using the command “model”. It also assumes that the model requires one input file, namely model.inp, for which a template file model.tpl is provided. It further assumes that all model‑generated observations can be read from one output file, namely model.out, using the instructions provided in the instruction file model.ins. You will almost certainly need to alter these names. If there are, in fact, multiple model input and/or output files, don’t forget to alter the variables NTPLFLE and NINSFLE in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
- The PESTGEN default values for all other PEST control variables can be read from figure 4.1.
Once you have made all necessary changes to the PESTGEN‑generated PEST control file, you should check that your input dataset is complete and consistent using program PESTCHEK. If PESTCHEK informs you that all is correct, then you can run PEST.

- **Detailed Summary:** 

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PESTGEN creates a PEST control file (case.pst) using a parameter value file (parfile) and observation value file (obsfile) (sections 2.2 and 2.3).  It uses default values;  PESTMODE is "estimation," parameters are in separate groups, derivatives use relative increments (0.01) switching to three-point parabolic (PHIREDSWH=0.1), no prior information is included, parameters are relative-limited (RELPARMAX=3.0), and observations have a weight of 1.0.  Errors in parfile or obsfile halt execution.
- **Next Summary:** TPL2PST creates a partial PEST control file from template files, populating the "control data," "singular value decomposition," "parameter groups," "parameter data," and "model input/output" sections. It is useful for models with many parameters (e.g., pilot points from PLPROC input files). Manual editing and additional steps (using OLPROC, PESTPREP1, PESTPREP2) are required to complete the file.

### Summary
**Figure 4.1 shows PEST control file variables; shaded variables are used by PEST++, some are optional.  The first line is "pcf". Values are space/tab delimited; strings with spaces are quoted.  Blank lines and comments (#) are allowed (PEST ≥15, PEST++ ≥4).  PEST++ ignores some sections (Table 4.1);  PEST++-specific variables use the "++" prefix.**

### Header
**4.4 Control Variables**

### Content
Figure 4.1 names variables which appear in a PEST control file. They are listed according to the position that they occupy in the file. This figure omits sections of the PEST control file that programs of the PEST++ suite ignore. It also omits control variables which are optional for PEST but are ignored by PEST++ programs. It does include some variables, however, which must be present within a PEST control file even though their values are not used by programs of the PEST++ suite. The presence of these variables defines line numbers and/or the locations of variables that follow them on a certain line. A control file provided to a PEST++ suite program should include all of these variables.
In figure 4.1, variables whose values are actually used by a program of the PEST++ suite to control its operations are shaded; these are described below. Of these variables, those which are optional are enclosed in square brackets. The roles of all other variables which appear in figure 4.1 are discussed in PEST documentation. Nevertheless, a number of these variables are discussed herein as PEST-acceptable values for these variables will preclude objections being raised by the PESTCHEK checking utility (see below).
It is also important to note that not all programs of the PEST++ suite use all of the variables that are shaded in figure 4.1. Furthermore, any particular PEST++ program may use a particular PEST control variable under certain circumstances.

### Summary
**To perform predictive analysis,  copy twofit.pst to twofit1.pst, changing PESTMODE to "prediction", increasing NOBS to 14, NOBSGP to 2, NTPLFLE and NINSFLE to 2, adding observation group "predict" and observation "o14" (weight=0.0),  changing the model command line to "model.bat", adding "in2.tpl in2.dat" and "out2.ins out2.dat" to the model input/output section, and adding a "predictive analysis" section (NPREDMAXMIN=1, PD0=5.0E-3, PD1=5.2E-3, PD2=1.0E-2, ABSPREDLAM=0.0, RELPREDLAM=0.005, ABSPREDSWH=0.0, RELPREDSWH=0.05, ABSPREDSTP=0.0, RELPREDSTP=0.005, NPREDNORED=4, NPREDSTP=4, INITSCHFAC=1.0, MULSHFAC=2.0, NSEARCH=1).**

### Header
**18.2.3 The PEST Control File**

### Content
We would now like to obtain the maximum possible value for the soil specific volume at a water content of 0.4 compatible with the model being calibrated against our laboratory dataset. Let us do this by assuming that the model can still be considered to be calibrated if the objective function under calibration conditions is as high as 5.0E-3; this is thus the value assigned to the predictive analysis control variable PD0.
The PEST control file used in the parameter estimation process was named twofit.pst. This file should be copied to file twofit1.pst and the following alterations made (actually this has already been done for you).
1. Replace the word “estimation” with the word “prediction” on the third line of this file.
2. When undertaking a predictive analysis run there is an extra observation, this being the model prediction. Hence the number of observations (i.e. NOBS) must be increased from 13 to 14 on the fourth line of file twofit1.pst.
3. There will now be two observation groups, so alter the fifth entry on line four of file
1. twofit1.pst (i.e. NOBSGP) to 2.
2. There are now two model input files and two model output files, so alter the first two entries on the fifth line of file twofit1.pst (i.e. NTPLFLE and NINSFLE) to 2 and 2 respectively.
3. In the “observation groups” section of the PEST control file add the observation group “predict”.
4. In the “observation data” section of the PEST control file add an extra observation named “o14”. Assign this to the observation group “predict”. Provide whatever observation value and weight that you like, as these will be ignored by PEST. It is probably best to make both of these 0.0, just in case you wish to run PEST later using the same file in “estimation” mode; by assigning the weight as zero, the “prediction observation” will contribute nothing to the objective function if that occurs.
5. Alter the model command line to “model.bat” in the “model command line” section of the new PEST control file.
6. The two model input files are named in1.dat and in2.dat; the first is used for the calibration component of the composite model, the second is used for the predictive component of the composite model. A PEST template file already exists for the first model input file (i.e. in.tpl). We will introduce a new template file for the second model input file shortly; it will be called in2.tpl. So alter the model input filename to in1.dat on the first line of the “model command line” section of file twofit1.pst; then add another line beneath this comprised of the entries “in2.tpl” and “in2.dat”.
7. The model output files are named out1.dat and out2.dat; the first is produced by the calibration component of the composite model while the second is produced by the predictive component of the composite model. A PEST instruction file already exists for the first model output file (i.e. out.ins). We will introduce a new instruction file for the second one shortly; it will be called out2.ins. So alter the model output filename to “out1.dat” on the third line of the “model command line” section of file twofit1.pst; then add another line underneath this comprised of the entries “out2.ins” and “out2.dat”.
8. Add a “predictive analysis” section to file twofit1.pst. Because we wish to maximise the prediction, NPREDMAXMIN is assigned the value of 1. As mentioned above, PD0 is 5.0E-3. Set PD1 to 5.2E-3 and set PD2 to be twice as high as PD0, i.e. 1.0E-2. Variables governing operation of the Marquardt lambda, the switching from two point to three point derivatives calculation, and the termination of execution will be set in relative rather than absolute terms, so set ABSPREDLAM, ABSPREDSWH and ABSPREDSTP to 0.0. RELPREDLAM, RELPREDSWH and RELPREDSTP should be set to their recommended values of .005, .05 and .005 respectively. NPREDNORED and NPREDSTP should be set at their recommended values of 4 and 4. Contrary to the advice provided in chapter 8, we will not conduct a line search for each Marquardt lambda, so set the control variables INITSCHFAC, MULSHFAC and NSEARCH to 1.0, 2.0 and 1 respectively.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** The text describes using soil clod shrinkage data to fit two straight lines using Equation 18.1.1 with parameters s1, s2, y1, and xc in the pestex subfolder. The TWOLINE program reads parameters and water contents from in.dat, adjusts parameters using PEST, and generates input files for calculations. The final prediction value is 0.786.
- **Detailed Summary:** This text details the process of using soil clod shrinkage data for modeling. PEST software is employed to estimate parameters and generate input files for TWOLINE calculations. A composite model is run under calibration and prediction conditions, with specific steps outlined for predictive analysis. The final prediction value is 0.786.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** A batch file (model.bat, Figure 18.15) runs a composite model:  first under calibration conditions (copying in1.dat to in.dat, running twoline, copying out.dat to out1.dat), then under prediction conditions (using in2.dat and out2.dat).  Intermediate files are deleted beforehand to prevent errors if the model fails to run. Screen output is suppressed using `> nul`.  Test the composite model by typing "model" at the prompt and examining out1.dat and out2.dat.
- **Next Summary:** in2.tpl and out2.ins (provided) are, respectively, a template for in2.dat and an instruction file for reading the prediction from out2.dat.  Both in.tpl and in2.tpl contain parameter spaces for parameters used in both calibration and prediction model runs; these parameters are written to both input files before running the composite model.
