### Summary
**NOPTMAX (integer, 50 recommended) sets maximum iterations; 0 runs one model; -1 or -2 generates a JCO file.  PESTPP-GLM uses PHIREDSTP (real, 0.005), NPHISTP (integer, 4), NPHINORED (integer, 4), RELPARSTP (real, 0.005), and NRELPAR (integer, 4) for termination; PESTPP-IES uses all except RELPARSTP and NRELPAR. Other PEST++ programs use only NOPTMAX.**

### Header
**4.6.9 Eighth Line**

### Content
The eighth line of the “control data” section of a PEST control file holds variables which control termination of an inversion process. These are NOPTMAX, PHIREDSTP, NPHISTP, NPHINORED, RELPARSTP and NRELPAR. Suitable (PESTCHEK-friendly) values for these variables are provided in figure 4.2, namely 50, 0.005, 4, 4, 0.005 and 4. PESTPP-GLM uses all of these variables; PESTPP-IES uses all except RELPARSTP and NRELPAR. Other programs of the PEST++ suite use only NOPTMAX.
NOPTMAX, an integer variable, sets the maximum number of iterations that an inversion or optimization process is allowed to run. However, values of 0, -1 and -2 trigger behaviour that is dependent on the PEST++ program that reads the PEST control file.
If NOPTMAX is set to 0, PESTPP-GLM does not estimate parameters. Instead it completes one model run using parameter values supplied in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file. It computes objective function components based on the result of this single model run. This can be used to ensure that PESTPP-GLM setup is correct, and that weights assigned to observations in the “observation data” section of the PEST control file are suitable.
If NOPTMAX is set to -1 or -2, PESTPP-GLM calculates a Jacobian matrix and stores it in a Jacobian matrix file (i.e., a JCO file). If asked to do so, it also calculates linear statistics based on that Jacobian matrix. It then ceases execution. The same Jacobian matrix is available for more complex linear analysis using pertinent PEST utilities, as well as PyEMU. The Jacobian matrix that is stored in the JCO file can also be put to other uses; see section 3.4.
PHIREDSTP is a real variable whereas NPHISTP is an integer variable. If, in the course of a PESTPP-GLM inversion process, there have been NPHISTP optimization iterations for which (Φ*i* - Φ*min* )/Φ*i* ≤ PHIREDSTP (Φ*i* being the objective function value at the end of the *i*th optimization iteration and Φmin being the lowest objective function achieved to date), PESTPP-GLM considers that the inversion process is at an end. Alternatively, if PESTPP-GLM has failed to lower the objective function over NPHINORED successive iterations, it ceases execution. PESTPP-IES supplies these same termination criteria to ensemble-mean objective functions.
If the magnitude of the maximum relative parameter change is less than RELPARSTP over NRELPAR successive iterations, then PESTPP-GLM ceases execution. The relative parameter change between iterations for any parameter is calculated using equation 3.2. PESTPP-GLM evaluates this change for all adjustable parameters at the end of all iterations, and determines the relative parameter change with the highest magnitude. If this maximum relative change is less than RELPARSTP, a counter is advanced by one; if it is greater than RELPARSTP, the counter is zeroed.

### Summary
**NOPTMAX (integer) sets maximum iterations; 0 runs one model; -1 or -2 calculates the Jacobian matrix.  PHIREDSTP (real) and NPHISTP (integer) define convergence criteria based on objective function reduction. NPHINORED (integer) sets iterations without improvement before stopping. RELPARSTP (real) and NRELPAR (integer) use maximum relative parameter change for termination.  PHISTOPTHRESH (real, optional) stops if the objective function is below its value. LASTRUN (integer, optional) controls the final model run; PHIABANDON (real, optional) stops if the objective function exceeds its value.**

### Content
NOPTMAX
NOPTMAX, an integer variable, sets the maximum number of iterations that PEST is allowed to undertake on a particular parameter estimation run. If you wish to ensure that PEST termination is triggered by other criteria, more indicative of convergence to an optimal parameter, you should set this variable to a high value such as 50.
Two settings for NOPTMAX have special significance however. If NOPTMAX is set to 0, PEST will not estimate parameters, nor even calculate a Jacobian matrix. Instead it will terminate execution after just one model run. This setting can be used to ensure that PEST setup is correct; at the same time, it can be used to compute objective function components and residuals based on initial parameter values provided in the PEST control file.
If NOPTMAX is set to -2 PEST will calculate the Jacobian matrix, store it in a JCO file, and then cease execution immediately. This matrix can then be used for linear analysis, and/or for construction of an SVD-assist input dataset.
Setting NOPTMAX to –1 also instructs PEST to compute the Jacobian matrix. However after doing this, PEST records the same information on its output files as that which it would normally record on completion of an inversion process. This includes composite sensitivities and, if pertinent, post-calibration uncertainty and covariance statistics calculated from parameter sensitivities. It then undertakes a final model run so that model input and output files remaining after PEST execution is complete pertain to parameters values provided in the PEST control file.
PHIREDSTP and NPHISTP
PHIREDSTP is a real variable whereas NPHISTP is an integer variable. If, in the course of the parameter estimation process, there have been NPHISTP optimisation iterations for which (Φ - Φmin)/Φ ≤ PHIREDSTP, PEST will consider that the inversion process is at an end.
For many cases 0.005 and 4 are suitable values for PHIREDSTP and NPHISTP respectively. However you must be careful not to set NPHISTP too low if the optimal values for some parameters are near or at their upper or lower bounds (as defined by the parameter variables PARLBND and PARUBND discussed below). In this case it is possible that the magnitude of the parameter upgrade vector may be curtailed over one or a number of iterations to ensure that no parameter value overshoots its bound. The result may be smaller reductions in the objective function than would otherwise occur on these iterations. It would be a shame if these reduced reductions were mistaken for the onset of parameter convergence to the optimal set.
NPHINORED
If PEST has failed to lower the objective function over NPHINORED successive iterations, it will terminate execution. NPHINORED is an integer variable; a value of 3 or 4 is often suitable.
RELPARSTP and NRELPAR
If the magnitude of the maximum relative parameter change between iterations is less than RELPARSTP over NRELPAR successive iterations, PEST will cease execution. The relative parameter change between iterations for any parameter is calculated using equation 4.2.4. PEST evaluates this change for all adjustable parameters at the end of all iterations, and determines the relative parameter change with the highest magnitude. If this maximum relative change is less than RELPARSTP, a counter is advanced by one; if it is greater than RELPARSTP, the counter is zeroed. All adjustable parameters, whether they are relative-limited or factor-limited, are involved in the calculation of the maximum relative parameter change. RELPARSTP is a real variable for which a value of 0.005 is often suitable. NRELPAR is an integer variable; a value of 3 or 4 is normally satisfactory.
PHISTOPTHRESH, LASTRUN and PHIABANDON
If PHISTOPTHRESH (a real variable) is set to a positive number, PEST will cease execution if the objective function falls below this value at the end of any iteration. Note that this criterion is applied to the measurement objective function if PEST is run in “regularisation” mode (see chapter 9). Alternatively, if PHISTOPTHRESH is set to zero or a negative number, then it is ignored. An error condition will occur if PHISTOPTHRESH is set to a positive number while PEST is asked to run in “predictive analysis” or “pareto” modes.
If supplied, the integer LASTRUN variable must follow the PHISTOPTHRESH variable on the eighth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file; PHISTOPTHRESH must also then be supplied. If LASTRUN is set to zero, then PEST will not undertake a final model run using optimised parameters upon termination of execution. If it is not set to zero it must be set to one (its default value).
The real-valued PHIABANDON variable optionally follows LASTRUN (which must be provided if PHIABANDON is provided). If, at the end of the first model run, and any iteration thereafter, the objective function (or measurement objective function if PEST is run in “regularisation” mode) is greater than PHIABANDON, PEST will terminate execution. Set this to a very high number, or to a non-positive number (or omit it altogether), for it to have no effect.

### Summary
**Figure 4.1 shows PEST control file variables; shaded variables are used by PEST++, some are optional.  The first line is "pcf". Values are space/tab delimited; strings with spaces are quoted.  Blank lines and comments (#) are allowed (PEST ≥15, PEST++ ≥4).  PEST++ ignores some sections (Table 4.1);  PEST++-specific variables use the "++" prefix.**

### Header
**4.4 Control Variables**

### Content
Figure 4.1 names variables which appear in a PEST control file. They are listed according to the position that they occupy in the file. This figure omits sections of the PEST control file that programs of the PEST++ suite ignore. It also omits control variables which are optional for PEST but are ignored by PEST++ programs. It does include some variables, however, which must be present within a PEST control file even though their values are not used by programs of the PEST++ suite. The presence of these variables defines line numbers and/or the locations of variables that follow them on a certain line. A control file provided to a PEST++ suite program should include all of these variables.
In figure 4.1, variables whose values are actually used by a program of the PEST++ suite to control its operations are shaded; these are described below. Of these variables, those which are optional are enclosed in square brackets. The roles of all other variables which appear in figure 4.1 are discussed in PEST documentation. Nevertheless, a number of these variables are discussed herein as PEST-acceptable values for these variables will preclude objections being raised by the PESTCHEK checking utility (see below).
It is also important to note that not all programs of the PEST++ suite use all of the variables that are shaded in figure 4.1. Furthermore, any particular PEST++ program may use a particular PEST control variable under certain circumstances.

### Summary
**In "regularisation" mode, PEST stops if NOPTMAX iterations elapse, the measurement objective function reaches the target (PHIMLIM, REGCONTINUE="nocontinue"), PHISTOPTHRESH is reached, parameter changes are minimal (RELPARSTP, NRELPAR), or objective function improvement is slow (PHIREDSTP, NPHISTP, NPHINORED, REGCONTINUE="continue").  User termination is often preferable, especially during early calibration attempts.**

### Header
**9.1.6 Termination Criteria**

### Content
When running in “regularisation” mode, PEST will cease execution if the following conditions are met.
1. NOPTMAX iterations have elapsed.
2. The measurement objective function falls below the user-supplied target measurement.
Objective function and the REGCONTINUE regularisation variable is missing or set to “nocontinue”.
1. The measurement objective function falls below the value of the optional PHISTOPTHRESH variable supplied in the “control data” section of the PEST control file, regardless of the setting of the REGCONTINUE variable.
2. Parameter changes between iterations are minimal as assessed through reference to the RELPARSTP and NRELPAR variables provided in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
3. The measurement objective function is greater than PHIMLIM but is falling very slowly as assessed through reference to the PHIREDSTP, NPHISTP and NPHINORED variables provided in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
4. The measurement objective function is lower than PHIMLIM, REGCONTINUE has been set to “continue” and the regularisation objective function is falling very slowly as assessed through reference to the PHIREDSTP, NPHISTP and NPHINORED variables provided in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
In practice, it is often best for a user to terminate PEST execution him/herself, especially during an early calibration attempt of a new model where the target measurement objective function may be set very low in an attempt to find out just how good a fit with the calibration dataset PEST can actually achieve.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Tikhonov regularization in PEST enhances stability by reducing error variance and incorporating expert knowledge. Use IREGADJ, SVD, or LSQR with MAXSING and EIGTHRESH settings for stability. PEST stops after NOPTMAX iterations, reaching target objectives, minimal parameter changes, or slow improvement. Regularization mode categorizes observations into "regul" groups, adjusting weights with a regularization weight factor.

User termination is recommended, especially in early calibration.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Tikhonov regularization minimizes error variance and improves numerical stability by incorporating expert knowledge.  A low target objective function may cause instability; IREGADJ helps but SVD or LSQR (with MAXSING and EIGTHRESH settings or, for many parameters, LSQR) ensures stability.
- **Next Summary:** To use PEST's "regularisation" mode, set the PESTMODE variable in the "control data" section to "regularisation".
