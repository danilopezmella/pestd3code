### Summary
**PEST maximizes parameter precision in model input files.  Control variables PRECIS ("single" or "double") and DPOINT ("point" or "nopoint") affect precision and decimal point inclusion.  Smaller spaces may omit decimal points (if DPOINT="nopoint") to increase significant figures;  however, caution is advised.  Multiple parameter spaces use the minimum width, right-justified.**

### Header
**2.2.6 How PEST Fills a Parameter Space with a Number**

### Content
PEST writes as many significant figures to a parameter space as it can. It does this so that even if a parameter space must be small in order to satisfy the input field requirements of a model, there is still every chance that a parameter value can be distinguished from its incrementally-varied counterpart so as to allow proper derivatives calculation with respect to that parameter. Also, as has already been discussed, even though PEST adjusts its internal representation of a parameter value to the precision with which the model can read it so that PEST and the model are using the same number, in general more precision is better.
Two user-supplied control variables, PRECIS and DPOINT affect the manner in which PEST writes a parameter value to a parameter space. Both of these variables are provided to PEST through the PEST control file. PRECIS is a character variable which must be supplied as either “single” or “double”. It determines whether single or double precision protocol is to be observed in writing parameter values; unless a parameter space is greater than 13 characters in width it has no bearing on the precision with which a parameter value is written to a model input file, as this is determined by the width of the parameter space. If PRECIS is set to “single”, exponents are represented by the letter “e”; also if a parameter space is greater than 13 characters in width, only the last 13 spaces are used in writing the number representing the parameter value, any remaining characters within the parameter space being left blank. For the “double” alternative, up to 23 characters can be used to represent a number, and the letter “d” is used to represent exponents; also, extremely large and extremely small numbers can be represented.
If a model’s input data fields are small, and there is nothing you can do about it, every effort must be made to “squeeze” as much precision as possible into the limited parameter spaces available. PEST will do this anyway, but it may be able to gain one or more extra significant figures if it does not need to include a decimal point in a number if the decimal point is redundant. Thus if a parameter space is 5 characters wide and the current value of the
The parameter to which this field pertains is 10234.345, PEST will write the number as “1.0e4” or as “10234” depending on whether it must include the decimal point or not. Similarly, if the parameter space is 6 characters wide, the number 106857.34 can be represented as either “1.07e5” or “1069e2” depending on whether the decimal point must be included or not.
By assigning the string “nopoint” to the PEST control variable DPOINT, you can instruct PEST to omit the decimal point in the representation of a number if it can. However this should be done with great caution. If the model is written in FORTRAN and numbers are read using free field input, or using a field width specifier such as “(F6.0)” or “(E8.0)”, the decimal point is not necessary. However in other cases the format specifier will insert its own decimal point (e.g. for specifiers such as “(F6.2)”), or enforce power-of-10 scaling (e.g. for specifiers such as “(E8.2)”) if a decimal point is absent from an input number. Hence if you are unsure what to do, assign the string “point” to the control variable DPOINT; this will ensure that all numbers written to model input files will include a decimal point, thus overriding point-location or scaling conventions implicit in some FORTRAN format specifiers.
Note that if a parameter space is 13 characters wide or greater and PRECIS is set to “single”, PEST will include the decimal point regardless of the setting of “DPOINT”, for there are no gains to be made in precision through leaving it out. Similarly, if PRECIS is set to “double”, no attempt is made to omit a decimal point if the parameter space is 23 characters wide or more.
**Table 2.1 Representations of the number 12345.67**
|parameter space width|DPOINT|
|---|---|
|8|12345.67|
|7|12345.7|
|6|12346.|
|5|1.2e4|
|4|1.e4|
|3|***|
|2|**|
As explained below, a template file may contain multiple spaces for the same parameter. In such a case, PEST will write the parameter value to all those spaces using the minimum parameter space width specified for that particular parameter; for the wider spaces the number will be right-justified, with spaces padded on the left. In this way a consistent parameter value is written to all spaces pertaining to the one parameter.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** PEST software uses template, instruction, and control files for model input and output. Templates, created with text editor or software, are validated with TEMPCHEK, INSCHEK, and PESTCHEK. Parameters are replaced in templates, and model input files should match for precision. Instruction files extract model outputs. Precision is crucial for accurate derivative calculations.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST provides model input files with parameter values for runs. Templates are required for ASCII input files with parameters, while binary files need a translator program. Templates should be less than 2000 characters wide and have a ".tpl" extension. PEST replaces delimited character sequences with parameter values in templates. Parameters are referenced in templates, control files, and utility programs. Model input files should match template parameter spaces for precision. Control variables affect precision and decimal point inclusion. Zoning simplifies template creation for large models with spatially distributed parameters. Advanced spatial parameterization methods are available. TEMPCHEK verifies template correctness and generates model input files.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Template parameter spaces should be wider than values in the model input file, especially for free-field input (add whitespace/commas). For formatted input, expand spaces to match the field width defined in the format specifier, ensuring parameter value discrimination.
- **Next Summary:** For large models with spatially distributed parameters,  zoning simplifies template creation.  Replace each zone's constant property value with a unique parameter identifier in the model input file. PEST reconstructs the array using parameter values from the control file. Parameters may appear across multiple template and input files; each must be defined in the control file.  More advanced spatial parameterization methods exist (e.g., pilot points).

### Summary
**SCREENDISP ("noverbose" or "verbose") controls TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK screen output. NPAR matches the number of parameters in template and parameter variation files. NOBS matches the number of observations in instruction files. NTPFLE is the number of template files; NINSFLE is the number of instruction files. PRECIS ("single" or "double") sets numerical precision (single usually suffices).**

### Header
**17.2.6 Control Data Section**

### Content
SCREENDISP
SCREENDISP is a character variable which can take either one of two possible values. These values are “noverbose” and “verbose”. In the former case, when SENSAN runs TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK it redirects all of the screen output from these programs to the null file; hence the user is not aware that they are running. In the latter case, TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK output is directed to the screen in the usual fashion.
Once you have set up a SENSAN run and ensured that everything is working correctly, a nicer screen display is obtained by using the “noverbose” option. In this case you should ensure that the model likewise produces no screen output by redirecting its output to the null file using, for example, the command
model > nul
to run the model. For a UNIX system this command becomes
model > /dev/null
If SENSAN is thus left to produce the only screen output, you can monitor its progress and detect any SENSAN error messages if they are written to the screen.
NPAR
This is the number of parameters. It must agree with the number of parameters cited in the template file(s) used by SENSAN. It must also agree with the number of parameters named in the parameter variation file provided to SENSAN.
NOBS
NOBS is the number of “observations”, i.e. the number of model outcomes used in the sensitivity analysis process. It must agree with the number of observations cited in the instruction file(s) provided to SENSAN.
NTPFLE
NTPFLE is the number of template files to be used by SENSAN. For each template file there must be a corresponding model input file; see below. Note that a given template file can be used to write more than one model input file; however two templates cannot write the same model input file.
NINSFLE
NINSFLE is the number of instruction files used by SENSAN to read model outcomes. For each instruction file there must be a matching model output file. Note that the same instruction file cannot read more than one model output file (observation values would be overwritten); however two different instruction files can read the same model output file.
PRECIS
PRECIS is a character variable which must take either the value “single” or “double”. It determines whether single or double precision protocol is used to represent a very large or very small number, or a number in a wide parameter space; see section 2.2.6 for more details. The value “single” is usually appropriate.

### Summary
**DERZEROLIM (optional) defines a Jacobian matrix zero threshold for compressed storage. NTPLFLE is the number of template files; NINSFLE is the number of instruction files. PRECIS ("single" or "double") sets precision. DPOINT ("point" or "nopoint") controls decimal point inclusion. NUMCOM, JACFILE, MESSFILE (Chapter 12) handle model-calculated derivatives. OBSREREF (Chapter 14) activates observation re-referencing.**

### Header
**4.2.5 Fourth Line**

### Content
DERZEROLIM
Like MAXCOMPDIM, DERZEROLIM is optional. If supplied, it supports the use of MAXCOMPDIM, defining a threshold below which the value of an element of the Jacobian matrix can be considered to be zero, and hence omitted from compressed storage.
NTPLFLE
This is an integer variable, informing PEST of the number of model input files which contain parameters; PEST must write each of these files prior to a model run. As there must be one template file for each such model input file, NTPLFLE is also equal to the number of template files which PEST must use in writing the current parameter set. A model may have many input files; however PEST is concerned only with those which it needs to rewrite prior to each model run, i.e. those for which there are template files. As explained later, a single template file may, under some circumstances, be used to write more than one model input file. In such a case you must count each template file - model input file pair separately in determining NTPLFLE.
NINSFLE
This is the number of instruction files. There must be one instruction file for each model output file containing model-generated observations which PEST reads. (In some circumstances, a single model output file may be read by more than one instruction file; however each instruction file - model output file pair is counted separately in determining NINSFLE).
PRECIS
PRECIS is a character variable which must be either “single” or “double”. If it is supplied to PEST as “single”, PEST writes parameters to model input files using single precision protocol; hence parameter values will never be greater than 13 characters in length (even if the parameter space allows for a greater length) and the exponentiation character is “e”. If PRECIS is supplied as “double”, parameter values are written to model input files using double precision protocol; the maximum parameter value length is 23 characters and the exponentiation symbol is “d”. See section 2.2.6.
DPOINT
This character variable must be either “point” or “nopoint”. If DPOINT is provided with the value “nopoint” PEST will omit the decimal point from representations of parameter values on model input files if the decimal point is redundant, thus making room for the use of one extra significant figure. If DPOINT is supplied as “point” (which is normally recommended), PEST will ensure that the decimal point is always present. See section 2.2.6.
NUMCOM, JACFILE and MESSFILE
These variables are used to control the manner in which PEST can obtain derivatives directly from the model if these are available; see chapter 12. For normal operation these should be set to 1, 0 and 0 respectively. Alternatively, all of them can be omitted. However if one of
them is cited in the PEST control file then all of them must be cited. Also if a value is supplied for NUMCOM, then a DERCOM value must be supplied for all parameters in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file; If NUMCOM is 1, then all of these DERCOMs must also be 1.
OBSREREF
Observation re-referencing is activated by adding the string “obsreref” to the fourth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. The “obsreref” string can be placed anywhere on this line. Observation re-referencing can be de-activated (the default condition) by omitting this string, or by placing the string “noobsreref” on this line. Observation re-referencing is discussed in chapter 14 of this manual.

### Summary
**PEST creates parameter value files (case.par, case.bpa for SVD-assisted inversion) containing parameter names, values, SCALE, and OFFSET (from the control file).  The first line lists PRECIS and DPOINT.  Utilities read/write these files;  manual creation uses "single", "point", 1.0, and 0.0 for PRECIS, DPOINT, SCALE, and OFFSET, respectively (Figure 2.1).**

### Header
**2.2 Parameter Value File**

### Content
The parameter value file is described in section 5.3.2 of part I of this manual. A parameter value file is written by PEST whenever an improved set of parameters is obtained. At any stage of the inversion process it thus contains the best set of parameters computed to date. The expected extension of a parameter value file is “.par”; however when PEST is conducting SVD‑assisted inversion it also writes a parameter value file containing base parameter values, this having an extension of “.bpa”.
A number of utility programs documented in this manual read and/or write parameter value files. There may be some occasions where you may need to write a parameter value file yourself for one of these programs to read. Fortunately this is easy, as its specifications are simple. An example of a parameter value file is shown below.
single point
ro1          1.00                  1.0               0.0
ro2          40.0                  1.0               0.0
ro3          1.00                  1.0               0.0

h2         10.0                  1.0               0.0
Figure 2.1 A parameter value file.
The first line of a parameter value file cites the PEST character variables PRECIS and DPOINT, the values for which are provided in the “control data” section of a PEST control file. Then follows a line for each parameter. Each line contains a parameter’s name, its current value and the values of the SCALE and OFFSET variables for that parameter as supplied in the PEST control file.
Entries on all lines of a parameter value file must be separated by one or more spaces. If a utility program writes a parameter value file, it normally refers to a PEST control file to obtain values for PRECIS, DPOINT, SCALE and OFFSET. If you write this file yourself, suitable values for these variables are “single”, “point”, “1.0” and “0.0” as shown in the above figure.

### Summary
**NTPFLE and NINSFLE (integers >1) specify template and instruction file counts.  PRECIS ("single") and DPOINT ("point") control parameter value formatting (not used by PEST++). NUMCOM (integer, 1 or omitted for single command lines) specifies the number of model command lines.  These variables are used by PEST but not PEST++.**

### Header
**4.6.5 Fourth Line **

### Content
The two leading variables on this line are NTPFLE and NINSFLE. Both of these are integers. Both must be greater than 1. Even though these variables are not read by programs of the PEST++ suite, both should be given correct values to ensure that a PEST control file is PESTCHEK-friendly. NTPFLE is the number of template files featured in the “model input” section of the PEST control file, while NINSFLE is the number of instruction files featured in the “model output” section of the PEST control file.
PRECIS and DPOINT are text variables which guide PEST in the writing of parameter values on model input files. Programs of the PEST++ suite do not use these variables. Set them to “single” and “point” respectively to render a PEST control file PESTCHEK-friendly.
NUMCOM, an integer variable, is the number of model command lines featured in the “model command line” section of a PEST control file. If there is only a single command line, set this to 1 or omit it altogether.
