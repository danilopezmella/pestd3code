### Summary
**NTPFLE and NINSFLE (integers >1) specify template and instruction file counts.  PRECIS ("single") and DPOINT ("point") control parameter value formatting (not used by PEST++). NUMCOM (integer, 1 or omitted for single command lines) specifies the number of model command lines.  These variables are used by PEST but not PEST++.**

### Header
**4.6.5 Fourth Line **

### Content
The two leading variables on this line are NTPFLE and NINSFLE. Both of these are integers. Both must be greater than 1. Even though these variables are not read by programs of the PEST++ suite, both should be given correct values to ensure that a PEST control file is PESTCHEK-friendly. NTPFLE is the number of template files featured in the “model input” section of the PEST control file, while NINSFLE is the number of instruction files featured in the “model output” section of the PEST control file.
PRECIS and DPOINT are text variables which guide PEST in the writing of parameter values on model input files. Programs of the PEST++ suite do not use these variables. Set them to “single” and “point” respectively to render a PEST control file PESTCHEK-friendly.
NUMCOM, an integer variable, is the number of model command lines featured in the “model command line” section of a PEST control file. If there is only a single command line, set this to 1 or omit it altogether.

### Summary
**SCREENDISP ("noverbose" or "verbose") controls TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK screen output. NPAR matches the number of parameters in template and parameter variation files. NOBS matches the number of observations in instruction files. NTPFLE is the number of template files; NINSFLE is the number of instruction files. PRECIS ("single" or "double") sets numerical precision (single usually suffices).**

### Header
**17.2.6 Control Data Section**

### Content
SCREENDISP
SCREENDISP is a character variable which can take either one of two possible values. These values are “noverbose” and “verbose”. In the former case, when SENSAN runs TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK it redirects all of the screen output from these programs to the null file; hence the user is not aware that they are running. In the latter case, TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK output is directed to the screen in the usual fashion.
Once you have set up a SENSAN run and ensured that everything is working correctly, a nicer screen display is obtained by using the “noverbose” option. In this case you should ensure that the model likewise produces no screen output by redirecting its output to the null file using, for example, the command
model > nul
to run the model. For a UNIX system this command becomes
model > /dev/null
If SENSAN is thus left to produce the only screen output, you can monitor its progress and detect any SENSAN error messages if they are written to the screen.
NPAR
This is the number of parameters. It must agree with the number of parameters cited in the template file(s) used by SENSAN. It must also agree with the number of parameters named in the parameter variation file provided to SENSAN.
NOBS
NOBS is the number of “observations”, i.e. the number of model outcomes used in the sensitivity analysis process. It must agree with the number of observations cited in the instruction file(s) provided to SENSAN.
NTPFLE
NTPFLE is the number of template files to be used by SENSAN. For each template file there must be a corresponding model input file; see below. Note that a given template file can be used to write more than one model input file; however two templates cannot write the same model input file.
NINSFLE
NINSFLE is the number of instruction files used by SENSAN to read model outcomes. For each instruction file there must be a matching model output file. Note that the same instruction file cannot read more than one model output file (observation values would be overwritten); however two different instruction files can read the same model output file.
PRECIS
PRECIS is a character variable which must take either the value “single” or “double”. It determines whether single or double precision protocol is used to represent a very large or very small number, or a number in a wide parameter space; see section 2.2.6 for more details. The value “single” is usually appropriate.

### Summary
**PESTGEN uses default names ("model", model.inp, model.tpl, model.out, model.ins); change these as needed, updating NTPLFLE and NINSFLE if necessary.  Verify the final control file using PESTCHEK before running PEST.  Other PESTGEN defaults (Figure 4.1) may require modification.**

### Header
**4.2 PESTGEN**

### Content
- PESTGEN assumes that the model is run using the command “model”. It also assumes that the model requires one input file, namely model.inp, for which a template file model.tpl is provided. It further assumes that all model‑generated observations can be read from one output file, namely model.out, using the instructions provided in the instruction file model.ins. You will almost certainly need to alter these names. If there are, in fact, multiple model input and/or output files, don’t forget to alter the variables NTPLFLE and NINSFLE in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
- The PESTGEN default values for all other PEST control variables can be read from figure 4.1.
Once you have made all necessary changes to the PESTGEN‑generated PEST control file, you should check that your input dataset is complete and consistent using program PESTCHEK. If PESTCHEK informs you that all is correct, then you can run PEST.

- **Detailed Summary:** 

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PESTGEN creates a PEST control file (case.pst) using a parameter value file (parfile) and observation value file (obsfile) (sections 2.2 and 2.3).  It uses default values;  PESTMODE is "estimation," parameters are in separate groups, derivatives use relative increments (0.01) switching to three-point parabolic (PHIREDSWH=0.1), no prior information is included, parameters are relative-limited (RELPARMAX=3.0), and observations have a weight of 1.0.  Errors in parfile or obsfile halt execution.
- **Next Summary:** TPL2PST creates a partial PEST control file from template files, populating the "control data," "singular value decomposition," "parameter groups," "parameter data," and "model input/output" sections. It is useful for models with many parameters (e.g., pilot points from PLPROC input files). Manual editing and additional steps (using OLPROC, PESTPREP1, PESTPREP2) are required to complete the file.

### Summary
**DERZEROLIM (optional) defines a Jacobian matrix zero threshold for compressed storage. NTPLFLE is the number of template files; NINSFLE is the number of instruction files. PRECIS ("single" or "double") sets precision. DPOINT ("point" or "nopoint") controls decimal point inclusion. NUMCOM, JACFILE, MESSFILE (Chapter 12) handle model-calculated derivatives. OBSREREF (Chapter 14) activates observation re-referencing.**

### Header
**4.2.5 Fourth Line**

### Content
DERZEROLIM
Like MAXCOMPDIM, DERZEROLIM is optional. If supplied, it supports the use of MAXCOMPDIM, defining a threshold below which the value of an element of the Jacobian matrix can be considered to be zero, and hence omitted from compressed storage.
NTPLFLE
This is an integer variable, informing PEST of the number of model input files which contain parameters; PEST must write each of these files prior to a model run. As there must be one template file for each such model input file, NTPLFLE is also equal to the number of template files which PEST must use in writing the current parameter set. A model may have many input files; however PEST is concerned only with those which it needs to rewrite prior to each model run, i.e. those for which there are template files. As explained later, a single template file may, under some circumstances, be used to write more than one model input file. In such a case you must count each template file - model input file pair separately in determining NTPLFLE.
NINSFLE
This is the number of instruction files. There must be one instruction file for each model output file containing model-generated observations which PEST reads. (In some circumstances, a single model output file may be read by more than one instruction file; however each instruction file - model output file pair is counted separately in determining NINSFLE).
PRECIS
PRECIS is a character variable which must be either “single” or “double”. If it is supplied to PEST as “single”, PEST writes parameters to model input files using single precision protocol; hence parameter values will never be greater than 13 characters in length (even if the parameter space allows for a greater length) and the exponentiation character is “e”. If PRECIS is supplied as “double”, parameter values are written to model input files using double precision protocol; the maximum parameter value length is 23 characters and the exponentiation symbol is “d”. See section 2.2.6.
DPOINT
This character variable must be either “point” or “nopoint”. If DPOINT is provided with the value “nopoint” PEST will omit the decimal point from representations of parameter values on model input files if the decimal point is redundant, thus making room for the use of one extra significant figure. If DPOINT is supplied as “point” (which is normally recommended), PEST will ensure that the decimal point is always present. See section 2.2.6.
NUMCOM, JACFILE and MESSFILE
These variables are used to control the manner in which PEST can obtain derivatives directly from the model if these are available; see chapter 12. For normal operation these should be set to 1, 0 and 0 respectively. Alternatively, all of them can be omitted. However if one of
them is cited in the PEST control file then all of them must be cited. Also if a value is supplied for NUMCOM, then a DERCOM value must be supplied for all parameters in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file; If NUMCOM is 1, then all of these DERCOMs must also be 1.
OBSREREF
Observation re-referencing is activated by adding the string “obsreref” to the fourth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. The “obsreref” string can be placed anywhere on this line. Observation re-referencing can be de-activated (the default condition) by omitting this string, or by placing the string “noobsreref” on this line. Observation re-referencing is discussed in chapter 14 of this manual.

- **Previous Summary:** NPAR (total parameters), NOBS (observations, excluding dummy), NPARGP (parameter groups), NPRIOR (prior information items), and NOBSGP (observation groups) are integer variables in the PEST control file.  In "estimation" mode, adjustable parameters should not exceed weighted observations plus prior information, unless using SVD or LSQR.

### Summary
**The SENSAN control file (Figure 17.2, recommended ".sns" extension) starts with "scf", contains sections marked by "*", and uses many PEST variables. It includes control data, SENSAN files (parameter variation file, base output file, relative output file, sensitivity file), model command line, and model input/output (template and instruction files, Figure 17.3).**

### Header
**17.2.5 SENSAN Control File**

### Content
It is recommended, though it is not essential, that the SENSAN control file be provided with a filename extension of “.sns”. Use of this default extension avoids the need to type in the entire SENSAN control filename when running either SENSAN or SENSCHEK.
Figure 17.2 shows a SENSAN control file. Figure 17.3 provides specifications of the SENSAN control file. As is apparent, the SENSAN control file resembles, to some extent, the PEST control file. Like the PEST control file, the SENSAN control file must begin with a three-character code, namely “scf”, identifying it as a SENSAN control file. Like the PEST control file, the SENSAN control file is divided into sections by lines beginning with the “*” character. And like the PEST control file, the SENSAN control file provides information to SENSAN through the values taken by certain input variables, many of which are also used by PEST. Where such variables are, indeed, used by PEST, they have identical meanings for both SENSAN and PEST.

- **Previous Summary:** SENSAN uses a parameter variation file (Figure 17.1) providing parameter values for each model run.  Parameter names (≤12 characters) must match template file names;  SENSCHEK (Part II) checks for inconsistencies.  Base parameter values (if used) are on the second line.  The file can contain many rows for numerous model runs.  Values are space, comma, or tab-delimited.
