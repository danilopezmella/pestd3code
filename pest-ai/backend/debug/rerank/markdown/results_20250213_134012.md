### Summary
**RLAMBDA1 (initial Marquardt lambda, ~10.0) and RLAMFAC (Marquardt lambda adjustment factor, ~2.0 or -3.0) control lambda adjustments during iterations.  PHIRATSUF (objective function reduction ratio, ~0.3) determines iteration completion; if not met, PHIREDLAM is used.**

RLAMBDA1
This real variable is the initial Marquardt lambda. As discussed in the previous section, each iteration of the inversion process undertaken by PEST is divided into two parts. The first part comprises calculation of the Jacobian matrix. The second part is devoted to the testing of parameter upgrades that are calculated using different values of the Marquardt lambda. The role of the Marquardt lambda is described in section 5.4.2 of Doherty (2015).
During any one iteration of the inversion process PEST attempts parameter improvement using a number of different Marquardt lambdas. The starting value of the Marquardt lambda during any one iteration is inherited from the previous iteration; it is generally somewhat lower than that which allowed calculation of the lowest objective function during that iteration. Over the course of the entire inversion process the Marquardt lambda should generally fall. However it may rise if an inverse problem is poorly posed.
RLAMBDA1 is the initial value of the Marquardt lambda. This informs PEST of the first value that it should test during the first iteration of the inversion process. A value of 10.0 is appropriate in most cases. However if PEST complains about the normal matrix being singular you may need to raise it. (A better alternative would be to add regularisation to the PEST control file and/or employ singular value decomposition or LSQR as a solution mechanism for the inverse problem.)
RLAMFAC
RLAMFAC, a real variable, is the factor by which PEST adjusts the Marquardt lambda as it tests different values of this variable for their efficacy in lowering the objective function. RLAMFAC must be greater than 1.0; a value of 2.0 seems to work well on many occasions.
When PEST reduces lambda it divides by RLAMFAC; when it increases lambda it multiplies by RLAMFAC. PEST reduces lambda if it can. However if the inverse problem is nonunique and is unsupplemented by regularisation or by use of singular value decomposition or LSQR as a solution device, or if a reduction in lambda does not lower the objective function, PEST has no choice but to increase lambda.
Alternatively, the Marquardt lambda can be given a negative value less than -1.0. Suppose that it is given a value of -3.0. Then PEST will adjust the lambda adjustment factor during each iteration of the inversion process so that lambda can achieve a value of 1.0 with three adjustments (if PEST decides to move it in this direction). This allows rapid adjustment of the Marquardt lambda if this is suddenly required, as can happen if local parameter insensitivity.
promulgates sudden problem ill-posedness.
More specifically, suppose that RLAMFAC is supplied as –r where r is positive. Let λ be the value of the Marquardt lambda at the beginning of a particular iteration, this being inherited from the previous iteration as described above. Then a Marquardt lambda adjustment factor f for use in the current iteration is calculated as follows.
f = min[λ1/r, 2.0] if λ > 1.0 (4.2.1a)
f = min[(1/λ)1/r, 2.0] if λ < 1.0 (4.2.1b)
f = 2.0 if λ = 1.0 (4.2.1c)
If supplying a negative value for RLAMFAC it is important to note that the higher the absolute value assigned to a negative RLAMFAC, the smaller will be the actual iteration-specific Marquardt lambda adjustment factor. This is opposite to the case for a positive setting of RLAMFAC. In both cases however, the absolute value of RLAMFAC must be greater than 1.0.
An RLAMFAC value of -3.0 works well on most occasions.
PHIRATSUF
During any one iteration of the inversion process, PEST may calculate a parameter upgrade vector using a number of different Marquardt lambdas. First it lowers lambda and, if this is unsuccessful in lowering the objective function, it then raises lambda. If, at any stage, it calculates an objective function which is a fraction PHIRATSUF or less of the starting objective function for that iteration, PEST considers that the goal of the current iteration has been achieved and moves on to the next iteration. Thus PEST will commence iteration i+1 if, at any stage during iteration i
Φij/Φi-1 ≤ PHIRATSUF (4.2.2)
where Φi-1 is the lowest objective function calculated for iteration i-1 (and hence the starting value for iteration i) and Φj is the objective function corresponding to a parameter set i calculated using the j’th Marquardt lambda tested during iteration i.
PHIRATSUF (which stands for “phi ratio sufficient”) is a real variable for which a value of 0.3 is mostly appropriate. If it is set too low, model runs may be wasted in search of an objective function reduction which it is not possible to achieve, given the linearity approximation upon which the inversion equations described in Doherty (2015) are based. If it is set too high, PEST may not be given the opportunity of refining lambda in order that its value continues to be optimal as the inversion process progresses.
PHIREDLAM
If a new/old objective function ratio of PHIRATSUF or less is not achieved as the effectiveness of different Marquardt lambdas in lowering the objective function is tested, PEST must use some other criterion in deciding when it should move on to the next iteration. This criterion is partly provided by the real variable PHIREDLAM.

### Content
The first lambda that PEST employs in calculating the parameter upgrade vector during any particular iteration is the lambda inherited from the previous iteration, possibly reduced by a factor of RLAMFAC (unless it is the first iteration, in which case RLAMBDA1 is used). Unless, through the use of this lambda, the objective function is reduced to less than PHIRATSUF of its value at the beginning of the iteration, PEST then tries another lambda,
less by a factor of RLAMFAC than the first. If the objective function is lower than for the first lambda (and still above PHIRATSUF of the starting objective function), PEST reduces lambda yet again; otherwise it increases lambda to a value greater by a factor of RLAMFAC than the first lambda for the iteration. If, in its attempts to find a more effective lambda by lowering and/or raising lambda in this fashion, the objective function begins to rise, PEST accepts the lambda and the corresponding parameter set giving rise to the lowest objective function for that iteration, and moves on to the next iteration. Alternatively if the relative reduction in the objective function between the use of two consecutive lambdas is less than PHIREDLAM, PEST takes this as an indication that it is probably more efficient to begin the next iteration than to continue testing the effect of new Marquardt lambdas. Thus if
(j-1 - j)/j-1 ≤ PHIREDLAMi i i (4.2.3)
where ij is the objective function value calculated during optimisation iteration i using the j’th trial lambda, PEST moves on to iteration i+1.
A suitable value for PHIREDLAM is between 0.01 and 0.05. If it is set too large, the criterion for moving on to the next iteration is too easily met and PEST is not given the opportunity of adjusting lambda to its optimal value for that particular stage of the parameter estimation process. On the other hand if PHIREDLAM is set too low, PEST will test too many Marquardt lambdas on each iteration of the inversion process when it would be better off starting a new iteration. (Note that where model runs are parallelised, the testing of too many Marquardt lambdas may not be so much of an issue as it keeps otherwise idle processors busy.)
NUMLAM
This integer variable places an upper limit on the number of lambdas that PEST will test during any one iteration. It should normally be set between 5 and 10 (normally closer to 10); however if RLAMBDA1 is set to zero (which is not recommended) it must be set to 1.
JACUPDATE
The Broyden Jacobian update procedure is described in section 5.4.2 of Doherty (2015). It provides a mechanism for improving the Jacobian matrix based on model outputs calculated during model runs undertaken for the purpose of testing parameter upgrades calculated using different values of the Marquardt lambda.
If JACUPDATE is omitted from the fifth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file, or if it is set to zero, Broyden updating of the Jacobian matrix does not occur. However if it is set to n, where n is a positive integer, Broyden updating will be undertaken during the second part of every PEST iteration following the first n attempts to upgrade parameters using n different values of the Marquardt lambdas. Alternatively, it can be set to 999. In this case the Jacobian matrix is updated after the first parameter upgrade attempt, and every parameter upgrade attempt thereafter.
Experience indicates that Broyden Jacobian updating can work well on most occasions, but on some occasions does not. At the time of writing it is difficult to predict when it is likely to work well and when the opposite is likely to occur. The “safest” option is not to activate it as it can, under some circumstances, actually hinder the progress of the inversion process. Still, these occasions appear to be relatively rare, and in the majority of cases it is worth a try.
LAMFORGIVE
Sometimes, when a model is provided with a particular set of parameters, it fails to run to completion. Its output file is not then written. PEST reports this error condition and ceases execution with an appropriate error message. This situation is most likely to arise during those phases of the parameter estimation process where PEST is altering the value of the Marquardt lambda and testing new upgraded parameter values; this is the stage of the inversion process where parameters provided to the model are most different from their predecessors, and hence where model run failure is most likely to occur.
In most deployment contexts, a better course of action for PEST to take is to ignore the failed model run and attempt calculation of further parameter upgrades using other values of the Marquardt lambda. This response to model run failure can be instigated using the LAMFORGIVE variable.
LAMFORGIVE should be placed on the fifth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file following the JACUPDATE variable if it is present, or the NUMLAM variable if JACUPDATE is absent. (Actually LAMFORGIVE can be placed in front of the JACUPDATE variable if desired.) It must be supplied as “lamforgive” (to activate model run failure forgiveness) or “nolamforgive” (to de-activate model run failure forgiveness). If it is omitted, a default value of “nolamforgive” is used by PEST.

### Summary
**In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST iteratively adjusts Marquardt lambda to maximize/minimize a prediction while maintaining the objective function ≤ PD1.  If Φ ≤ PD1, it prioritizes prediction adjustment; otherwise, it prioritizes objective function reduction.  It stops testing lambdas when the relative reduction in the objective function or (Φ - PD0) is ≤ PHIREDLAM or when the relative (RELPREDLAM) or absolute (ABSPREDLAM) prediction change is insufficient.  A line search (NSEARCH) may refine the prediction.**

### Header
**8.3.2 Predictive Analysis Section of the PEST Control File**

### Content
When run in “predictive analysis” mode, the solution procedure used by PEST is very similar to that used in “estimation” mode. During each iteration PEST first fills the Jacobian matrix; then it calculates some trial parameter upgrade vectors on the basis of a number of different values of the Marquardt lambda. The latter is automatically altered by PEST during the course of the solution process using a complex adjustment procedure. If the current value of the objective function is above PD1, PEST adjusts the Marquardt lambda in such a manner as to lower the objective function; if the objective function is below PD1, PEST’s primary concern is to raise or lower the model prediction.
After PEST has tested a few different Marquardt lambdas it must make the decision as to whether to continue calculating parameter upgrade vectors based on new lambdas or whether it should move on to the next optimisation iteration. If the objective function is above PD1 this decision is made using the same criteria as in normal PEST operation; these criteria are based on the efficacy of new lambdas in lowering the objective function. An important variable in this regard is PHIREDLAM. As is explained in section 4.2.6 of this manual, if PEST fails to lower the objective function by a relative amount equal to PHIREDLAM on successive parameter upgrade attempts using successive Marquardt lambdas, PEST will move on to the next optimisation iteration.
When PEST is run in “predictive analysis” mode, as the objective function approaches PD0 the relative change in the objective function, Φ, between Marquardt lambdas may be small; however the relative reduction in (Φ - Φ0) (i.e. the objective function minus PD0) may be sufficient to warrant testing the efficacy of another Marquardt lambda. The objective function value at which PEST stops testing for a relative objective function reduction, and begins testing for a relative reduction in (Φ - Φ0) is PD2. Generally this should be set at 1.5 to 2 times PD0. In either case the decision as to whether to try another lambda or move on to the next optimisation iteration is made through comparison with PHIREDLAM.
ABSPREDLAM and RELPREDLAM
During each iteration, after it has filled the Jacobian matrix, PEST tests the ability of a number of different values of the Marquardt lambda to achieve its objective. Its exact objective depends on the current value of the objective function Φ. If the objective function is above PD1, PEST’s highest priority is to lower it; if the objective function is less than PD1, PEST’s highest priority is to raise or lower (depending on the value of NPREDMAXMIN) the model prediction. In either case, PEST is constantly faced with the decision of whether to
test more lambdas or to move on to the next iteration. If the objective function is below PD1 and successive Marquardt lambdas have not succeeded in raising (lowering) the model prediction by a relative value of more than RELPREDLAM or by an absolute value of more than ABSPREDLAM, PEST will move on to the next optimisation iteration. Due to the fact that the approach to the critical point is often slow, these values may need to be set low. A value of 0.005 for RELPREDLAM is often suitable; the value for ABSPREDLAM depends on the context. If you would like one of these variables to have no effect on the predictive analysis process (which is mostly the case for ABSPREDLAM), use a value of 0.0.
INITSCHFAC, MULSCHFAC and NSEARCH
When undertaking predictive analysis, PEST calculates a parameter upgrade vector in accordance with the theory presented in Doherty (2015). However it has been found from experience that the predictive maximisation/minimisation process can sometimes be made more efficient if PEST undertakes a line search along the direction of its calculated parameter upgrade vector each time it calculates such a vector, in order to find the exact point of intersection of this vector with the min+ contour. However this search will not be undertaken unless the objective function has fallen below min+ at least once during any previous iteration.
A line search is undertaken for each trial value of the Marquardt lambda. The maximum number of model runs that PEST will devote to this line search for any value of lambda is equal to the user-supplied value of NSEARCH; set NSEARCH to 1 if you wish that no line search be undertaken. Otherwise, a good value is 15.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST optimizes predictions while maintaining the objective function below a threshold, considering post-calibration uncertainty. It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** To run PEST in "predictive analysis" mode, set PESTMODE to "prediction", define observation groups, and perform a prior "estimation" run. Adjust Marquardt lambda iteratively to maximize/minimize predictions while meeting objective function criteria. Use line search, adjust search parameters, and set termination conditions based on prediction improvement. User intervention can modify line search variables.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** The "predictive analysis" section (Figure 8.1) includes NPREDMAXMIN (1 for maximization, -1 for minimization), PREDNOISE (0 or 1, for prediction interval), PD0 (target objective function value), PD1 (acceptable objective function value), and PD2.  A "predict" group (one observation) is required.  The process requires a prior "estimation" run (Φmin).
- **Next Summary:** INITSCHFAC (0.2-0.3) sets the initial line search point. MULSCHFAC (1.3-1.7) adjusts the search distance.  PD1 should be ~0.2% higher than PD0 for line searches.  Tight ABSPREDSTP and RELPREDSTP values are recommended.  Lower RLAMBDA1 or set NUMLAM=1 to reduce line searches.  RELPREDSWH (~0.05) and ABSPREDSWH control switching to higher-order derivatives when the objective function is below PD1.  NPREDNORED limits iterations without prediction improvement.

The fifth line of the “control data” section of a PEST control file contains variables which control the way in which PEST selects a Marquardt lambda. Programs of the PEST++ suite which employ a Marquardt lambda do not read this line because they use their own lambda control variables.

### Summary
**PESTCHEK verifies PEST input datasets (control, template, and instruction files), checking for syntax errors and consistency (including parameter/observation counts, bounds, transformations, and prior information). It ignores PEST++-specific variables ("++" prefix) but can partially check PEST++ datasets.  Use `pestchek case`; the `/s` switch omits template/instruction file checks. *CHECK_TPLINS* (Boolean) controls parameter/observation alignment checks.**

### Header
**4.5 The PESTCHEK Utility**

### Content
PESTCHEK is a utility program that is supplied with the PEST suite. It reads an entire PEST input dataset, this being comprised of a PEST control file and all template and instruction files cited therein. It checks all of these files for correctness and consistency. In doing so, it performs all of the tasks performed by the TEMPCHEK and INSCHEK utilities that were mentioned in chapter 2 of this manual. However, it goes further than this. It ensures that any parameter that is cited in a template file is also cited in a PEST control file (and vice versa), and that any observation that is cited in an instruction file is also cited in the PEST control file (and vice versa). The benefits of such checking are obvious.
PESTCHEK also subjects a PEST control file to thorough error and consistency checking. For example, it informs a user if a parameter is not between its upper and lower bounds, or if a parameter which is denoted as being log-transformed is endowed with a zero or negative initial value. It checks that the number of tied-parent parameter relationships that are provided in the second half of the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file are in accordance with the number of parameters that are denoted as being tied in the first half of this section. Consistency checks are made between equations comprising the “prior information” section of a PEST control file and the transformation status of parameters in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file.
PESTCHEK ignores lines in a PEST control file that begin with the “++” string. Hence it performs no checking of control variables that are specific to members of the PEST++ suite. The above examples of its checking functionality indicate, however, that it can still be used to at least partially ensure the quality of a PEST++ input dataset. However, if it is to provide this service, certain conditions must be met. These include the following.
- Variables such as NOBS, NPARGP, NOBSGP and NPRIOR that are ignored by programs of the PEST++ suite, but that are read by PESTCHEK (and PEST), should have the correct values. These indicate the number of observations, parameter groups, observation groups and prior information equations respectively that are featured in a PEST control file. (Programs of the PEST++ suite evaluate these numbers themselves based on the contents of respective sections of a PEST control file.)
- Control variables such as those which govern PEST’s calculation of the Marquardt lambda (RLAMBDA1, RLAMFAC, PHIRATSUF, PHIREDLAM and NUMLAM) should be coherent. Suitable values are suggested below for these and other variables, though little will be said about their usage by PEST.
Variables appearing in a PEST control file which are used by members of the PEST++ suite are now described. At the same time, sensible, PESTCHEK-safe placeholder values are provided for all variables whose presence is required in a PEST control file, but which are not actually used by members of the PEST++ suite. The interested reader is referred to part I of the PEST manual for further details.
Note that all of the PEST++ tools will check that the parameters and observations between the control file and template/instruction files are aligned. This checking can be disabled by setting *CHECK_TPLINS* to false.
