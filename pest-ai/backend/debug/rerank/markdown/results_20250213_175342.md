### Summary
**PEST is advanced software for environmental model calibration and uncertainty analysis.  It acknowledges model parameter and prediction uncertainties, supporting decisions by identifying unlikely future events rather than predicting certain outcomes.  Used with other software, PEST quantifies uncertainties and helps decision-making by embracing real-world complexity.  Doherty (2015) provides theoretical background.**

**1.4 Philosophy**

### Content
At the time of writing, the PEST suite is by far the most advanced software available for environmental model calibration, and for post-calibration uncertainty analysis. As such, it holds a unique place in the environmental industry – not just for what it can do, but for what it can teach us about environmental modelling.
PEST, and its ancillary software, embraces the fact that environmental systems are complex, and that a model’s parameters and predictions are uncertain. Its use supports the critical notion that a model can never tell us what will happen in the future following adoption of a certain environmental management practice; this is an outcome of the uncertainties associated with most model predictions of environmental interest. However a model may tell us, with a high degree of confidence, what will NOT happen in the future. In order to accomplish this, it cannot be deployed on its own; instead it must be deployed in conjunction with high-end inversion software such as PEST. Under these circumstances models may then provide invaluable support to the decision-making process by allowing rejection of hypotheses that unwanted events will occur if certain courses of management action are taken. (These courses of management action will often include installation of monitoring systems which trigger responses to the crossing of pre-defined measurement thresholds.)
It follows that a model, as a simulator, does not constitute a decision-support tool. In contrast, the model, as a simulator, should constitute one of a number of software packages, which are used in partnership to
- quantify the uncertainties associated with predictions of management interest, and
- reduce those uncertainties to a level that is commensurate with information available from expert knowledge on the one hand and the historical behaviour of a system on the other hand.
Software packages used in concert to achieve these ends collectively constitute an indispensable tool for decision-support – a tool which embraces the complexity of the real world at the same time as it provides decision-makers with an understanding of the ramifications of that complexity for the decisions that they must make.
For a full discussion of the role of models in decision-making see Doherty and Simmons (2013) and Doherty and Vogwill (2016).
1.5 PEST- The Book
The following book can be downloaded from the PEST web site:
Doherty, J., 2015. Calibration and uncertainty analysis for complex environmental models. Published by Watermark Numerical Computing, Brisbane, Australia. 227pp, ISBN: 978-0-9943786-0-6
The numerous references to Doherty (2015) throughout this manual are to this text.
Doherty (2015) covers in details all of the theory embodied in PEST and its utility support software. It also discusses the ramifications of this theory for how models should be used in real-world environmental decision-making. It provides an extensive discussion on the theory and practice of regularisation – whether this is done manually through parameter simplification, or mathematically using subspace or Tikhonov methods. It also provides a critique of manual regularisation, and provides an in-depth discussion on why it is important to reflect environmental system complexity in model parameterisation complexity if models are to play a useful role in support of environmental decision-making. It shows how parameter nonuniqueness is not something to run away from, but something to embrace; after all, it is the parameters that cannot be estimated that contribute most to predictive uncertainty - generally much more than those which can be estimated. It demonstrates that the use of many parameters in an inversion problem does not necessarily lead to over-fitting; nor does it promulgate numerical instability, or result in solutions to the inverse problem which are unnecessarily complex. The book shows that parameter simplification is fundamental to achievement of a unique solution to an inverse problem, and that achievement of parameter simplification through mathematical means leads to reduction of potential for model predictive error at the same time as it allows quantification of this potential for error.
Parts I and II of this manual refer to the above book extensively. They do not repeat the theory presented in the book; nor do they discuss the ramifications of that theory for model deployment in the decision-making context. This enables these manuals to be somewhat shorter than they would otherwise be; it also enables them to concentrate on implementation details. As a PEST user, you are strongly advised to read the book, for this will provide you with the theoretical basis that you need to get the most out of PEST.

### Summary
**PEST runs models via system calls, requiring command-line accessibility; ideally, the model's directory should be in the PATH variable.  PEST can handle models run via batch files or scripts, including pre- and post-processors and multiple simulators.  To prevent errors, batch files should delete intermediate files.  The "start /w" command (Windows) prevents premature PEST output file checks, and keyboard input can be redirected from a text file.**

### Header
**1.6.1 The Model**

### Content
In the course of estimating its parameters, and/or of computing sensitivities of model outputs to parameters, PEST must run a model many times. It does this through a call to the operating system (known as a “system call”). This call has the same effect as typing the name of the model (and any arguments required by the model which follow its name) in a command line window (sometimes called a “DOS box” on a WINDOWS system). Hence the model must be accessible to a user (and therefore to PEST) through the command line. Ideally, the directory (i.e. folder) in which the model executable resides should be featured in the PATH environment variable so that the operating system knows where to find it.
Some models are not accessible to the user in this way. Some models can only be run through their own model-specific graphical user interface; they may be called as a DLL by this interface. Models which can only be accessed in this way cannot be used with PEST. Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of flexibility in what constitutes “a model” that
can be run by PEST. A model can be a batch (on a WINDOWS system) or script (on a UNIX system) file which runs one or a number of executable programs in succession. Hence a simulator can be accompanied by preprocessors and postprocessors; the former may manipulate parameters (for example interpolate pilot point parameters to the cells which constitute a model grid), while the latter may manipulate model outputs (for example interpolate model outputs from grid cell centres to the locations of observation points). The model may actually be comprised of a number of simulators which are run in succession (for example a flow model followed by a transport model). Where this is the case, it is a good idea to commence such a batch file with the command to delete all files which are written by one executable program and then read by another. Thus if the first executable does not run, the second executable will not read an old file generated by the first executable, mistaking it for a new one. It will therefore crash. The final output files which PEST must read will then be absent (PEST deletes these files before it runs the model). PEST will then cease execution gracefully with an appropriate error message.
Sometimes, in the WINDOWS environment, a model whose execution is initiated from the command line, or through a system call, returns control to the calling program (or the user prompt) immediately, even though it is still running. This would cause PEST to look for its output files, thinking that it has finished. This can be prevented by using the “start /w” command. Type start /? at the command line prompt for more details pertaining to the WINDOWS “start” command.
If, on commencement of execution, a model prompts the user for keyboard input, this situation can be easily accommodated. The keyboard responses to the model’s prompts can be placed into a text file. Suppose that this file is named model.inp. Suppose also that the name of the model executable file is model.exe, or simply model on a UNIX platform. Then if the model is run using the command model &lt; model.inp it will look to file model.inp rather than the keyboard for its input. PEST can run the model using this command without the need for any user involvement.

### Summary
**PESTGEN, Groundwater/Surface Water utilities aid PEST input file creation; TEMPCHEK, INSCHEK, and PESTCHEK check file integrity. PWTADJ1 and WTFACTOR adjust weights. EIGPROC and PHISTATS summarize inversion results; PARREP populates new control files.**

**1.7.2 Over-Determined Model Calibration**

### Content
Where a small number of parameters must be estimated, there is no need to include regularisation in a PEST control file. The PESTGEN utility can assist in PEST input file preparation. However programs provided with the PEST Groundwater and Surface Water Utility suite may provide more comprehensive assistance in PEST input dataset construction.
The integrity of PEST template and instruction files can be checked using the TEMPCHEK.
and INSCHEK utilities. The integrity of the entire PEST input dataset can be checked using the PESTCHEK utility.
After one model run has been completed, weights balancing between observation groups featured in the PEST dataset can be implemented using PWTADJ1. WTFACTOR provides further assistance in weights adjustment where observation numbers are large.
Upon completion of the parameter estimation process, EIGPROC can summarize information that is pertinent to the well-posedness (or otherwise) of that process. PHISTATS can provide a summary of objective function behaviour during the inversion process. If you wish to build a new PEST dataset starting with parameters calculated during the current PEST run, you can use the PARREP utility to populate the new PEST control file accordingly.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** This chapter discusses efficient calibration methods for models with tens of thousands of parameters using PEST. Adjoint techniques are recommended for highly parameterized models. Use compressed binary external derivatives files, 64-bit versions of PEST for large problems, and optimize Jacobian matrix storage. Prioritize linearity of regularization constraints and activate memory conservation for improved efficiency.
- **Detailed Summary:** 

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** For highly parameterized models (tens of thousands), model-calculated derivatives (adjoint techniques, Chapter 12) are necessary due to the excessive number of model runs and imprecision of finite differences.  Compressed binary external derivatives files are recommended; elements should be ordered by observation then parameter for optimal efficiency.
- **Next Summary:** In highly parameterized inversions, Jacobian matrix storage (dimensions (no+np)×m) can be excessive.  Many sensitivities and Tikhonov regularization elements are often zero. A data storage mechanism that omits zero-valued elements significantly reduces PEST's memory requirements.
