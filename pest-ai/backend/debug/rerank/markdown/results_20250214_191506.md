### Summary
**RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX (~10.0 unless highly nonlinear), and ABSPARMAX(N) limit parameter changes.  FACORIG prevents very small parameters from overly restricting adjustments. IBOUNDSTICK (0 or n iterations) "glues" parameters at bounds after n iterations; a value of 2-4 is suggested but generally inadvisable.**

### Header
**4.2.7 Sixth Line**

### Content
If you are unsure of how to set these parameters, a value of 10.0 for each of them is often suitable. In cases of extreme nonlinearity, be prepared to set them lower, however. But note that FACPARMAX can never be less than 1; RELPARMAX can be less than 1 as long as no parameter’s upper and lower bounds are of opposite sign.
The best value for ABSPARMAX(N) is context specific; hence no general advice can be provided on assigning a value to this variable. If no parameters are designated as absolute(N)-limited in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file, then ABSPARMAX(N) does not need to feature on the sixth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. If supplied, it is written as “absparmax(n) = value”. This string can be placed anywhere on this line; however it is recommended that it follow FACORIG. Three absolute limits feature in the following example of line 6 of the “control data” section of a PEST control file.

PEST iteration.
FACORIG
If, in the course of the inversion process, a parameter becomes very small, the relative or factor limit to subsequent adjustment of this parameter may severely hamper its growth back to higher values, resulting in very slow convergence to an objective function minimum. Furthermore, for the case of relative-limited parameters which are permitted to change sign, it is possible that the denominator of equation 4.2.4 could become zero.
To obviate these possibilities, choose a suitable value for the real variable, FACORIG. If the absolute value of a parameter falls below FACORIG times its original value, then FACORIG times its original value is substituted for the denominator of equation 4.2.4. For factor-limited parameters, a similar modification is introduced to equation 4.2.5. Thus the constraints that apply to a growth in absolute value of a parameter are lifted when its absolute value has become less than FACORIG times its original absolute value. However, where PEST wishes to reduce the parameter’s absolute value even further, factor-limitations are not lifted; nor are relative limitations lifted if RELPARMAX is less than 1. FACORIG is not used to adjust limits for log-transformed parameters.
FACORIG must be greater than zero. A value of 0.001 is often suitable.
IBOUNDSTICK
Operation of the IBOUNDSTICK variable is described in section 3.4.5 of this manual. It can be used to reduce the number of model runs required per iteration by permanently freezing at their bounds parameters which have encountered their bounds and seem reluctant to move from there. If IBOUNDSTICK is supplied as zero, or omitted altogether, PEST’s handling of bounds is unchanged from its normal operation as described in section 3.4.4. However if it is set to n (where n is a positive integer), PEST will permanently “glue” a parameter to its upper or lower bound if that parameter has resided there for n optimisation iterations. Once a parameter is “glued” to one of its bounds it will never move again, for PEST will no longer include this parameter in its upgrade vector calculations. Nor will it calculate derivatives with respect to this parameter, thus reducing the number of model runs required per iteration.
You should carefully note the following points regarding the use of IBOUNDSTICK.
1. If IBOUNDSTICK is set to 1, then parameters will be glued to their bounds from the moment that they strike them (beginning at the iteration immediately following the bounds encounter). Thus if the initial value of a parameter is at its upper bound and IBOUNDSTICK is set to 1, then the parameter will be glued to its bound from the very first iteration.
2. If IBOUNDSTICK is set to 2, then 1 complete iteration will elapse (in which the parameter is free to move back into allowed parameter space) since the iteration at which it encountered its bound before that parameter is glued to its bound.
If used, a good setting for IBOUNDSTICK is 2 to 4. However experience has shown that use of the IBOUNDSTICK variable is generally not advisable. Hence it should normally be omitted or set to zero. This is because, for nonlinear models, the sensitivities of parameters can depend not just on their own values, but on those of others. Hence a parameter may have a propensity to reside at its bound during certain stages of the inversion process but not at other stages. Another problem with use of bounds sticking functionality, is that PEST loses the capacity to calculate statistics such as composite sensitivities and the post-calibration.
parameter covariance matrix. Furthermore the derivative of the parameter is not included in the Jacobian matrix file. Hence the Jacobian matrix must be re-computed before linear analysis utilities described in part II of this manual can be used. These problems can be overcome by adopting the following procedure on completion of a PEST run in which bounds sticking is activated.

### Summary
**PEST limits parameter changes per iteration using relative, factor (b0/f ≤ b ≤ fb0), and absolute (|b-b0| < a) limits (PARCHGLIM, RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, ABSPARMAX).  FACORIG prevents unduly small parameter values from overly restricting changes.  These limits prevent overshooting the objective function minimum and enhance stability.**

### Header
**3.4.8 Parameter Change Limits**

### Content
No parameter can be adjusted by PEST above its upper bound or below its lower bound. However, as has already been discussed, PEST places a further limit on the amount by which a parameter is permitted to change in any one iteration of the inversion process. Unless the model under PEST’s control exhibits outrageously nonlinear behaviour, an updated parameter set calculated using one of the inverse problem solution strategies discussed by Doherty (2015) will result in a lowering of the objective function. (The objective function is defined in accordance with PEST’s current mode of operation.)
However if a model is highly nonlinear, the parameter upgrade vector may “overshoot” the objective function minimum, and the new value of the objective function may actually be worse than the old one. This is because the equations employed for calculation of the upgrade vector are all based on a local quasi-linearity assumption which may not extend as far into parameter space from current parameter estimates as the magnitude of the upgrade vector itself.
To obviate the possibility of overshoot, it is good practice to place a reasonable limit on the maximum change that any adjustable parameter is allowed to undergo in any one iteration. Such limits may be of three types, namely “relative”, “factor” and “absolute”. You must inform PEST, through the parameter-specific variable PARCHGLIM (residing in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file) which type of change limit applies to each adjustable parameter. Variables RELPARMAX and FACPARMAX provide the maximum allowed relative and factor changes for all relative-limited and factor-limited parameters respectively. Meanwhile ABSPARMAX(N) (where N can range from 1 to 10) provides the absolute change limit for parameters assigned to absolute change group N. These variables appear in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
Let f represent the user-defined maximum allowed parameter factor change for factor-limited parameters (i.e. FACPARMAX); f must be greater than unity. Then if b0 is the value of a
particular factor-limited parameter at the beginning of a PEST iteration, the value b of this same parameter at the beginning of the next iteration will lie between the limits
b0/f &le; b &le; fb0 (3.4.1a)
if b0 is positive, and
fb0 &le; b &le; b0/f (3.4.1b)
if b0 is negative. Note that if a parameter is subject to factor-limited changes, it can never change sign.
Let r represent the user-defined maximum allowed relative parameter change for all relative-limited parameters (i.e. RELPARMAX); r can be any positive number. Then if b0 is the value of a particular relative-limited parameter at the beginning of a PEST iteration, its value b at the beginning of the next iteration will be such that
b - b0 &le; r (3.4.2)
b0
In this case, unless r is less than or equal to unity, a parameter can, indeed, change sign. However there may be a danger in using a relative limit for some types of parameters in that if r is 1 or greater, b may fall to a minute fraction of b0 (or even to zero), without transgressing the parameter change limit. For some types of parameters in some models this will be fine; in other cases a parameter factor change of this magnitude may significantly transgress model linearity limits.
Suppose that, for a particular parameter, the parameter-specific variable PARCHGLIM is specified as “absparmax(N)” where N can range from 1 to 10. Suppose that ABSPARMAX(N) in the “control data” section of the PEST control file is assigned a value of a. Then, in any one iteration, PEST will limit changes to the value of this parameter such that
|b – b0| < a (3.4.3)
In implementing the conditions set by equations 3.4.1 to 3.4.3, PEST limits the magnitude of the parameter upgrade vector such that none of these equations is violated for any parameter to which the pertinent equation applies. Naturally, if only one type of parameter change limit is featured in a current PEST run (for example if parameters are all factor-limited or are all relative-limited) only the pertinent one of these limits is invoked.
If, in the course of the inversion process, PEST assigns to a parameter a value which is very small relative to its initial value, then either of equations 3.4.1 or 3.4.2 may place an undue restriction on subsequent parameter adjustments. Thus if b0 for one parameter is very small, the changes to all parameters may be set intolerably small so that equation 3.4.1 or equation 3.4.2 is obeyed for this one parameter. To circumvent this problem, PEST provides another variable, FACORIG (in the “control data” section of the PEST control file) which allows the user to limit the effect that an unduly low-valued parameter value can have in this regard. If the absolute value of a parameter is less than FACORIG times its initial absolute value and PEST wishes to adjust that parameter such that its absolute value will increase, then FACORIG times its initial value is substituted into equation 3.4.1 and the denominator of equation 3.4.2 for the parameter’s current value b0. A suitable value for FACORIG varies from case to case, though 0.001 is often appropriate. Note, however, that FACORIG is not used to adjust change limits for log-transformed parameters or for parameters that are subject
to an absolute change limit.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** This chapter introduces PEST, a tool for solving inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** The PEST control file's "parameter data" section manages parameter adjustments, including logarithmic transformations for stability. PARTRANS specifies parameter transformations, with options for fixed, log-transformed, or tied parameters. Bounds, scaling, and offsetting are used to prevent model errors and enhance stability. Parameter changes are limited to prevent over-adjustment. Dampening methods reduce oscillations during optimization.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Ideally, parameters should undergo a Kahunen-Loève transformation (see Doherty 2015, section 6.2.4) before estimation.  The BOUNDSCALE variable in the "control data" section offers a simpler alternative, normalizing parameters relative to their bounds.
- **Next Summary:** To avoid issues with relative- or factor-limited parameters having very low values, use absolute limits or adjust the OFFSET and bounds to prevent problematic values.

### Summary
**PARVAL1 (real) provides initial parameter values.  PARLBND and PARUBND (real) set lower and upper bounds (ignored for fixed/tied parameters). PARGP names the parameter group. SCALE and OFFSET (real) transform parameter values before writing to model input files. DERCOM (integer) selects the model command line for derivative calculation (Chapter 12); 0 uses external derivatives.**

### Header
**4.9.2 First Part**

### Content
PARVAL1, a real variable, is a parameter’s initial value. For a fixed parameter, this value remains invariant during the inversion process. For a tied parameter, the ratio of PARVAL1 to the parent parameter’s PARVAL1 sets the ratio between these two parameters that is maintained throughout the inversion process. For an adjustable parameter PARVAL1 is the parameter’s starting value which, together with the starting values of all other adjustable parameters, is successively improved during the inversion process.
Ideally, as explained by Doherty (2015), the initial value of a parameter should be the pre-calibration estimate of the parameter’s value based on expert knowledge alone. Through use of the ADDREG1 utility (see part II of this manual), this value can also be specified as the parameter’s “preferred value” when implementing Tikhonov regularisation.
Caution should be exercised in choosing an initial parameter value of zero for the following reasons.
- A parameter cannot be subject to relative or factor change limits during the first iteration of the inversion process if its value at the start of that iteration is zero. Furthermore FACORIG cannot be used to modify the action of RELPARMAX and FACPARMAX (the relative- and factor-limiting control variables) if a parameter’s original value is zero.
• A relative increment for derivatives calculation cannot be evaluated during the first PEST iteration for a parameter whose initial value is zero. If the parameter belongs to a group for which derivatives are, in fact, specified as “relative”, a non-zero DERINCLB variable must be provided for that group.
• If a parameter has an initial value of zero, the parameter can be neither a tied nor a parent parameter as the tied:parent parameter ratio cannot be calculated.
PARLBND and PARUBND
These two real variables represent a parameter’s lower and upper bound respectively. For adjustable parameters the initial parameter value (PARVAL1) must lie between these two bounds. However for fixed and tied parameters the values you provide for PARLBND and PARUBND are ignored. (The upper and lower bounds for a tied parameter are determined by the upper and lower bounds of the parameter to which it is tied, and by the ratio between the two.)
PARGP
PARGP is the name of the group to which a parameter belongs. As discussed already, parameter group names must be twelve characters or less in length and are case-insensitive. As derivatives are not calculated with respect to fixed and tied parameters, PEST provides a dummy group name of “none” to which such tied and fixed parameters can be assigned. Note that it is not obligatory to assign such parameters to this dummy group; they can be assigned to another group if you wish. However, any group other than “none” which is cited in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file must be properly defined in the “parameter groups” section of this file. (For reasons discussed above, assignment of fixed and tied parameters to the parameter group “none” is not recommended practice.)
SCALE and OFFSET
Just before a parameter value is written to a model input file it is multiplied by the real variable SCALE, after which the real variable OFFSET is added. The use of these two variables allows you to redefine the domain of a parameter. Because they operate on the parameter value “at the last moment” before it is written to the model input file, they take no part in the inversion process; in fact they can “conceal” from PEST the true value of a parameter as seen by the model, PEST estimating, instead, the parameter kp where
kp = (km - o)/s
Here kp is the parameter optimised by PEST, km is the parameter seen by the model, while s and o are the SCALE and OFFSET for that parameter. If you wish to leave a parameter unaffected by SCALE and OFFSET, set the SCALE to 1.0 and the OFFSET to 0.0.
DERCOM
If the NUMCOM variable in the “control data” section of the PEST control file is set to a number that is greater than 1, then PEST can use different commands to run the model when calculating derivatives with respect to different parameters. The value of the DERCOM variable associated with a particular parameter is the number of that command. Commands are listed in the “model command line” section of the PEST control file. They are numbered in order of appearance, starting at 1.
If the JACFILE variable in the “control data” section of the PEST control file is set to 1, then the values for some derivatives can be obtained from an external file. If derivatives with respect to a particular parameter are obtained externally in this manner, set DERCOM for that parameter to zero. See chapter 12 of this manual for further details.

### Summary
**RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX (≥1.0), and FACORIG (often 0.001) in the "control data" section limit parameter changes per iteration in PESTPP-GLM to prevent overshooting and oscillations.  RELPARMAX < 1.0 is allowed only if bounds are not of opposite sign.  Default values of 10.0 are often suitable.**

### Header
**4.6.7 Sixth Line**

### Content
This line contains the three real-valued variables, RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX and FACORIG. As is discussed in section 3.2.5 of this manual, these are used by PESTPP-GLM to limit the change that any parameter can undergo during any iteration of an inversion process. Where a model is highly nonlinear, and where adjustments to parameter values are calculated using local gradients (i.e., using a Jacobian matrix that is based on current parameter values), the calculated amounts by which parameters should change in order to accrue a reduction in an objective function may actually cause the objective function to rise because of large changes in the objective function gradient along the trajectory of parameter adjustment. Use of these control variables to limit the change that any parameter can undergo during any iteration of an inversion process can safeguard that process from severe oscillations caused by successive parameter over-adjustment and ensuing over-compensation. All parameters are subject to a change limit. The length of the overall parameter adjustment vector is reduced (but its direction is not changed) to ensure that these limits are respected.
Values of 10.0 are often suitable for both RELPARMAX and FACPARMAX. Note, however, that FACPARMAX can never be less than 1.0; RELPARMAX can be less than 1.0 as long as no parameter’s upper and lower bounds are of opposite sign. PESTCHEK will inform you if you get this wrong.
A suitable value for FACORIG is 0.001. See section 3.2.5 for further details.

### Summary
**PARVAL1 (real) is the initial parameter value (expert knowledge, optionally ADDREG1's preferred value for PESTPP-GLM/IES).  Zero initial values are problematic for PESTPP-GLM. PARLBND/PARUBND (real) set bounds (ignored for fixed/tied parameters). PARGP names the parameter group (≤12 characters). SCALE/OFFSET transform parameter values before writing to model input files (SCALE=1, OFFSET=0 for no transformation). DERCOM (integer, usually 1) selects model commands for PESTPP-GLM derivative calculations.**

### Content
PARVAL1, a real variable, is a parameter’s initial value. For a fixed parameter, this value remains invariant during an inversion, uncertainty analysis or optimization process. For a tied parameter, the ratio of PARVAL1 to the parent parameter’s PARVAL1 sets the ratio between these two parameters that is maintained throughout the inversion, uncertainty analysis or optimization process. For an adjustable parameter PARVAL1 is the parameter’s starting value which, together with the starting values of all other adjustable parameters, is successively improved during an inversion or optimization process.
If using PESTPP-GLM or PESTPP-IES, the initial value of a parameter should be the pre-calibration estimate of the parameter’s value based on expert knowledge alone. Through use of the PEST ADDREG1 utility (see part II of the PEST manual), this value can also be specified as the parameter’s “preferred value” when implementing Tikhonov regularization.
Caution should be exercised in choosing an initial parameter value of zero for the following reasons.
- If using PESTPP-GLM, a parameter cannot be subjected to relative or factor change limits during the first iteration of an inversion process if its value at the start of that iteration is zero. Furthermore, FACORIG cannot be used to modify the action of RELPARMAX and FACPARMAX (the relative- and factor-limiting control variables) in later iterations.
- A relative increment for derivatives calculation cannot be evaluated during the first iteration of parameter adjustment for a parameter whose initial value is zero. If the parameter belongs to a group for which derivatives are specified as “relative”, a non-zero DERINCLB variable must be provided for that group.
- If a parameter has an initial value of zero, the parameter can be neither a tied nor a parent parameter as the tied:parent parameter ratio cannot be calculated.
**PARLBND**
These two real variables represent a parameter’s lower and upper bound respectively. For adjustable parameters the initial parameter value (PARVAL1) must lie between these two bounds. However, for fixed and tied parameters the values you provide for PARLBND and PARUBND are ignored. (The upper and lower bounds for a tied parameter are determined by the upper and lower bounds of the parameter to which it is tied, and by the ratio between the two.)

Any group which is cited in the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file must be properly defined in the “parameter groups” section of that file.
**SCALE**
Just before a parameter value is written to a model input file, it is multiplied by the real variable SCALE, after which the real variable OFFSET is added. The use of these two variables allows you to redefine the domain of a parameter. Because they operate on the parameter value “at the last moment” before it is written to a model input file, they take no part in an inversion/optimization process; in fact they can “conceal” from programs of the PEST++ suite the true value of a parameter as seen by the model. Instead, a PEST++ program adjusts the parameter *kp* where *kp* = (*km* - *o*)/*s*. Here *kp* is the parameter adjusted by a PEST++ program, *km* is the parameter seen by the model, and *s* and *o* are the SCALE and OFFSET for that parameter. If you wish to leave a parameter unaffected by SCALE and OFFSET (the usual case), set the SCALE to 1.0 and the OFFSET to 0.0.
**DERCOM**
PESTPP-GLM (but not PESTPP-OPT) can use different commands to run a model when calculating derivatives with respect to different parameters. The value of the DERCOM variable associated with a particular parameter is the number of that command. Commands are listed in the “model command line” section of a PEST control file. They are implicitly numbered in order of appearance, starting at 1.
In most instances of PEST++ usage, only one command is used to run the model. DERCOM should be set to 1 for all parameters.
