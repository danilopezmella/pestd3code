### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** NOPTMAX (integer, 50 recommended) sets maximum iterations; 0 runs one model; -1 or -2 generates a JCO file.  PESTPP-GLM uses PHIREDSTP (real, 0.005), NPHISTP (integer, 4), NPHINORED (integer, 4), RELPARSTP (real, 0.005), and NRELPAR (integer, 4) for termination; PESTPP-IES uses all except RELPARSTP and NRELPAR. Other PEST++ programs use only NOPTMAX.
- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-GLM uses SVD for inversion, with settings overridable via a "singular value decomposition" section (MAXSING, EIGTHRESH). MAXSING directly sets dimensionality; EIGTHRESH sets it implicitly (ratio of squared singular values of Q½J).  Omit this section to use PESTPP-GLM defaults.  MAXSING should equal or exceed the number of parameters unless dimensionality reduction is desired.  *max_n_super*/ *super_eigthresh* (PEST++) control super parameter numbers in SVD-assisted inversion;  MAXSING/EIGTHRESH control SVD regardless of base/super parameter estimation.  PESTPP-IES and PESTPP-DA also use internal SVD defaults, which are overridden if the "singular value decomposition" section is present.

### Summary
**If *iteration_summary()* is true, PESTPP-GLM creates case.upg.csv (iteration, lambda, upgrade vector length, parameters, objective function components, sensitivities), case.ipar, case.iobj, case.isen, and case.rid files.  *jac_scale* (default true) scales parameters by sensitivities before estimation (Equation 5.4.6 of Doherty 2015), potentially reducing errors but increasing computation time.**

### Header
**6.2.11 Other Controls**

### Content
If the control variable *iteration_summary()* is set to *true*, then PESTPP-GLM records (and continually updates) a comma-delimited file named *case.upg.csv* (where “upg” stands for “upgrade”). This file lists the values of parameters used for every model run in which parameter upgrades are tested. Iteration numbers, lambda values and fractional lengths along parameter upgrade vectors are also recorded in this file. PESTPP-GLM also records files named *case.ipar*, *case.iobj*, *case.isen* and *case.rid*. The first three of these are comma-delimited files; they list iteration-specific values of parameters, objective function components and composite parameter sensitivities respectively. *case.rid* links model runs undertaken for derivatives calculation to run identifiers in the parallel run management file; a user can thus be informed of the agent that undertook a particular finite-difference model run.
If the *jac_scale()* control variable is set to *true*, the equations that are used for calculating parameter upgrades are slightly modified from those presented in section 6.2.1. Prior to estimation, parameters are scaled by their sensitivities. Estimated scaled parameters then undergo post-estimation back-transformation; see equation 5.4.6 of Doherty (2015). This strategy can reduce numerical errors in some instances; however, it can also increase computation times. The default value for *jac_scale()* is *true*.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Chapter 6 discusses automatic user intervention in PEST for regularization methods in parameter estimation. It suggests identifying and temporarily fixing insensitive parameters to improve matrix condition number and objective function. Parameters like DOAUI and MAXAUI customize intervention behavior, with options for mitigating bad derivatives and improving sensitivity.
- **Detailed Summary:** In unregularized inversions, insensitive parameters can lead to large adjustments beyond set limits, resulting in minimal objective function improvement. Increasing limits may not help; regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity is recommended. Use the parameter sensitivity file to identify insensitive parameters and consider temporarily holding them at current values using the case.hld file.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PESTPP-GLM saves composite parameter sensitivities (case.sen) per iteration: Doherty's (2015) *csp* statistic (Equation 6.18) and Hill and Tiedeman's (2007) statistic.  Regularization information is included/excluded in separate calculations; regularization weights are multiplied by the current regularization weight factor if included.

**ICOV, ICOR, IEIG (0 or 1) control writing of covariance, correlation, and eigenvector matrices to a matrix file. IRES (0 or 1) controls writing of a resolution data file (case.rsd). JCOSAVE ("jcosave" or "nojcosave") controls Jacobian matrix file (case.jco) saving. JCOSAVEITN ("jcosaveitn" or "nojcosaveitn") saves a JCO file for each iteration. VERBOSEREC ("verboserec" or "noverboserec") controls run record file verbosity.**

### Content
ICOV, ICOR and IEIG
If PEST is run in “estimation” mode, and if neither singular value decomposition nor LSQR is employed in solution of the inverse problem, then at the end of each iteration of the inversion process PEST can write a “matrix file” containing linear estimates of the posterior covariance and correlation coefficient matrices, as well as eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the posterior covariance matrix. Calculation of these matrices is based on the current Jacobian matrix. Settings of the ICOV, ICOR and IEIG variables determine which (if any) of these data are recorded in the matrix file. A setting of 1 for each of these variables will result in the corresponding information being recorded. On the other hand, a setting of 0 will result in the corresponding information not being recorded. Regardless of these settings, all of these matrices are recorded on the run record file at the end of the inversion process (provided, once again, that PEST is not run in “regularisation” mode and that neither singular value decomposition nor LSQR is used to solve the inverse problem.)
The posterior covariance matrix, together with its correlation coefficients and eigenvectors/eigenvalues, can be used to examine the “health” of an inverse problem in which regularisation is purely manual and therefore implied in the definition of the parameters themselves. This covariance matrix is computed using equation 5.2.13 of Doherty (2015). Note, however, that these matrices cannot be computed if an inverse problem is completely ill-posed.
A better way to compute a posterior covariance matrix is to use the PREDUNC7 utility; this is not troubled by problem ill-posedness. Other linear parameter and predictive uncertainty analysis possibilities are available through utilities discussed in part II of this manual. Furthermore, with mathematical regularisation in place, the information provided by eigenvector decomposition of the posterior covariance matrix, and by parameter correlation coefficients computed from this matrix, is not really needed, for the mathematical regularisation process, instead of the user, takes care of possible inverse problem ill-posedness. See Doherty (2015) for details.
IRES
This is an integer variable which controls the writing of a “resolution data file”. This is a binary file which is used by utilities such as RESPROC, RESWRIT and PARAMERR which compute the resolution matrix, and quantify post-calibration predictive error variance. The resolution data file is automatically named case.rsd, where case is the filename base of the PEST control file.
If omitted, IRES is set to 1. Writing of a resolution data file can therefore only be prevented if IRES is included in the PEST control file and specifically set to 0. This is its recommended setting, as the utility programs which use it are less informative than more recent programs such as those comprising the PREDVAR* and PREDUNC* suites which have superseded them; the latter programs do not read a resolution data file.
JCOSAVE
This optional text variable can be used to suppress recording of the binary Jacobian matrix file (i.e. JCO file). If supplied, it must be provided as “jcosave” or “nojcosave”. If omitted,
“jcosave” prevails. This variable can be placed anywhere following the mandatory IEIG or optional IRES variable on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. Its recommended value is “jcosave”, unless the inverse problem size is very large indeed and the MAXCOMPDIM variable has been employed to activate internal compressed Jacobian matrix storage; in the latter case the accessing of a large Jacobian matrix for the purpose of recording a JCO file can be computationally intensive.
JCOSAVEITN
JCOSAVEITN is an optional character variable which should be supplied as either “jcosaveitn” or “nojcosaveitn”. If the former string is supplied, PEST writes a JCO file at the end of every iteration, this containing the Jacobian matrix calculated during that iteration. The name of each such file is case.jco.N where N is the iteration number to which the JCO file pertains. Alternatively, if JCOSAVEITN is set to “nojcosaveitn”, or omitted altogether, PEST will not save a progression of JCO files in this manner. Note that the JCO file containing the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the best parameter set attained so far is saved to a file named case.jco in the usual manner, regardless of the setting of JCOSAVEITN. The JCOSAVEITN variable can be placed anywhere on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file following ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and, optionally, IRES. JCOSAVEITN should be set to “jcosaveitn” if it is desired that the MULJCOSEN utility be employed for monitoring of changes to composite parameter and/or observation sensitivities during the inversion process. See part II of this manual for a description of this utility.
VERBOSEREC
Where parameter, observation and prior information numbers are high, the PEST run record file becomes voluminous - so voluminous that it is almost impossible for a user to obtain useful information from it. PEST will write a much shorter run record file if VERBOSEREC (a text variable) is set to “noverboserec”. The default value for this variable (i.e. the value that will prevail if it is not supplied at all) is “verboserec”. The VERBOSEREC variable can be placed anywhere following ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and, optionally, IRES on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PHISTOPTHRESH, PHIABANDON, and LASTRUN control null space Monte Carlo.  PHIABANDON (high value or file) stops calibration if the objective function is too high; LASTRUN (0 or 1) controls the final model run.  A PHIABANDON schedule file provides iteration-specific thresholds.  If the objective function exceeds the threshold, the parameter adjustment process is abandoned.
- **Next Summary:** REISAVEITN ("reisaveitn" or "noreisaveitn") controls saving interim residuals files (case.rei, case.rei.N). PARSAVEITN ("parsaveitn" or "noparsaveitn") saves parameter values (case.par.N) per iteration. PARSAVERUN ("parsaverun" or "noparsaverun") saves run-specific parameter values (BEOPEST only, case.par.N_M).  An optional "sensitivity reuse" section (Chapter 7) governs sensitivity reuse.  An optional "singular value decomposition" section is recommended for most applications.

### Summary
**The "parameter data" section's second part lists tied parameters (PARNME, with PARTRANS="tied", and PARTIED, the parent parameter, which cannot be tied or fixed). Multiple parameters can be tied to one parent. The *tie_by_groups()* option ties all parameters within a group to a single group member, while respecting user-defined tied parameters.**

### Header
**4.9.3 Second Part**

### Content
The second part of the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file is comprised of one line for each tied parameter; if there are no tied parameters, the second part of the “parameter data” section must be omitted.
Each line within the second part of the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file consists of two entries. The first is PARNME. This is the name of a parameter already cited in the first part of the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file; PARTRANS must be “tied” for this parameter. The second entry on the line, the character variable PARTIED, holds the name of the parameter to which the first-mentioned parameter is tied, i.e., the “parent parameter” of the first-mentioned parameter. The parent parameter must not be a tied or fixed parameter itself.
Note that multiple tied parameters can be linked to a single parent parameter. However, a tied parameter can, naturally, be linked to only one parent parameter.
Programs of the PEST++ suite support a protocol for tying parameters together that may be convenient in some contexts. This is activated using the *tie_by_groups()* control variable. Denoting this variable as *true* effectively ties all parameters in a group to a single member of that group so that initial, intra-group parameter ratios are maintained as parameters are adjusted. However, it is important to note that this action does not affect any parameters that a user designates as tied to another parameter, or that has another parameter tied to it.

- **Detailed Summary:** The "parameter data" section in Figure 4.8 of the documentation lists parameters and tied parameters for template files. Parameters include PARNME (unique name), PARTRANS (transformation type), PARCHGLIM (change limits), PARVAL1 (initial value), PARLBND and PARUBND (bounds), PARGP (group), SCALE and OFFSET (transformation), and DERCOM (derivative calculation). Tied parameters link to parent parameters for shared values.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PARVAL1 (real) is the initial parameter value (expert knowledge, optionally ADDREG1's preferred value for PESTPP-GLM/IES).  Zero initial values are problematic for PESTPP-GLM. PARLBND/PARUBND (real) set bounds (ignored for fixed/tied parameters). PARGP names the parameter group (≤12 characters). SCALE/OFFSET transform parameter values before writing to model input files (SCALE=1, OFFSET=0 for no transformation). DERCOM (integer, usually 1) selects model commands for PESTPP-GLM derivative calculations.
- **Next Summary:** The "observation groups" section (Figure 4.6) lists unique group names (≤12 characters in PEST, ≤200 in PEST++, case-insensitive).  Prior information groups are also observation groups; observations and prior information cannot be in the same group. "regul" groups are for regularization constraints (used when PESTMODE="regularization"), creating regularization and measurement objective functions.

### Summary
**In the "observation groups" section,  COVFLE specifies covariance matrix files (e.g., cov1.dat, cov2.dat) for groups, overriding individual weights. Equation 3.7.2 is then used to calculate the objective function. In "regularisation" mode (Chapter 9), a multiplier is applied to covariance matrices for "regul" groups.  Covariance matrices must be square, symmetric, and positive definite, and match the group size.**

### Header
**4.19.1 General**

### Content
As was discussed in section 4.10, if a covariance matrix is supplied for an observation group (which, of course, includes a prior information group), the name of the file which holds that matrix must be placed alongside the name of the group in the “observation data” section of the PEST control file. Figure 4.15 shows a PEST control file in which two observation groups are endowed with observation covariance matrices. These two matrices are contained within files named cov1.dat and cov2.dat. Weights assigned to individual observations or prior information items which belong to these groups in the “observation data” or “prior information” sections of the PEST control file are then ignored. Equation 3.7.2 is used to compute the contribution made to the objective function by pertinent observation groups rather than equation 3.7.1. Note however, that if observations are assigned to observation groups whose names begin with “regul” while PEST is running in “regularisation” mode, then an overall multiplier is applied to the covariance matrix in accordance with PEST’s implementation of Tikhonov regularisation. See chapter 9 of this manual for details.

Figure 4.15 A PEST control file citing two covariance matrices.
The following rules must be followed when supplying covariance matrices for observation groups.
- The matrix must be square, symmetric and positive definite. (Actually a matrix cannot be positive definite unless it is symmetric).
- The number of rows and columns which comprise the matrix must be the same as the number of observations or prior information equations which comprise the observation group to which the covariance matrix is assigned.
If desired, the same covariance matrix can be provided to multiple observation groups.
