### Summary
**For highly parameterized models with compressed Jacobian storage (MAXCOMPDIM > 1), using indexed prior information improves efficiency.  A negative NPRIOR value in the "control data" section activates this. The "prior information" section then lists PILBL, PIVAL, WEIGHT, OBGNME per equation, followed by NUMINDEX lines (≥NPRIOR) specifying Jacobian matrix indices (column, row, value) for non-zero elements.**

### Header
**15.8 Accelerated Input of Prior Information**

### Content
When estimating values for a large number of parameters (for example ten thousand or more parameters), the handling of prior information that may provide Tikhonov constraints for these parameters may become problematical if compressed Jacobian storage is employed (i.e. if the MAXCOMPDIM variable in the “control data” section of the PEST control file is set to greater than 1). As has already been discussed, the Jacobian submatrix which holds this prior information is likely to be sparse; hence considerable benefits are to be gained from storing it in compressed form. However storage and retrieval of items that are stored in compressed format requires calculations to be carried out which may increase the computational burden of the overall inversion process.
Considerable computational advantage can be gained if prior information is provided to PEST in the same order as that in which it is stored internally in the compressed Jacobian array. Elements of the compressed Jacobian matrix are stored in row order, with zero-valued elements excluded. That is, elements are stored in the order J(i,j), J(i+1,j), J(i+2,j) etc., with the jump made to column j+1 when all non-zero values in column j have been stored. The row number is the observation (including prior information) number (i in this example), while the parameter number is the column number (j in this example).
In the “prior information” section of the PEST control file, the user supplies prior information in the form of equations. If more than one parameter is cited in any of these equations, the above ordering is not respected. Where many prior information equations are supplied in order to provide regularisation constraints for many estimated parameters, PEST may require a considerable amount of time to read and store this prior information when compressed Jacobian matrix storage is employed.
In order to overcome this problem, PEST provides an alternative means through which prior information can be supplied. This is referred to as “indexed prior information” herein.
PEST is informed that prior information is provided in indexed form in the “prior information” section of the PEST control file if the NPRIOR variable in the “control data” section of the PEST control file is supplied as negative. As usual, the absolute value of NPRIOR must indicate the number of prior information equations that are featured in the
current inverse problem.
When the indexed prior information protocol is adopted, the “prior information” section of the PEST control file is subdivided into two sections. There are no headers between these subsections. The first subsection should contain NPRIOR lines of data. Each line of this subsection must contain four entries. These are as follows.
- The name of the prior information equation (12 characters or less without quotes or blanks); this is the PILBL variable.
- The “observed value” of the prior information equation (a real number); this is the PIVAL variable.
- The weight associated with the prior information equation (a real number); this is the WEIGHT variable.
- The observation group to which the prior information equation belongs (12 characters or less citing a group that has already been named in the “observation groups” section of the PEST control file); this is the OBGNME variable.
Part of this subsection of the “prior information” section is exemplified in figure 15.5.

Figure 15.5 Part of the first subsection of the “prior information” section of a PEST control file in which prior information is supplied in indexed format.
Following NPRIOR items supplied as above is the second subsection of the “prior information” section of the PEST control file. This subsection begins with a line containing a single integer, this specifying the number of lines to follow. This integer must equal or exceed NPRIOR; it will be referred to as NUMINDEX herein.
Each of the following NUMINDEX lines must contain three entries. These are, in order:
- a column number of the Jacobian matrix (an integer);
- a row number of the Jacobian matrix (an integer);
- the value of the element of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the nominated row and column numbers.
A Jacobian matrix column number is obtained by counting parameters in order of their appearance in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file; fixed and tied parameters are omitted from this count. A row number is obtained by counting first observations, and then prior information equations, in order of their appearance in the PEST control file. For prior information equations, the row number must exceed NOBS (where NOBS is the number of observations featured in the PEST control file), and must be less than or equal to
NOBS+NPRIOR. It is the user’s task to calculate these indices him/herself; normally a PEST control file which features indexed prior information will be written by utility software which undertakes these calculations as part of its processing services.

### Summary
**NPAR (total parameters), NOBS (observations, excluding dummy), NPARGP (parameter groups), NPRIOR (prior information items), and NOBSGP (observation groups) are integer variables in the PEST control file.  In "estimation" mode, adjustable parameters should not exceed weighted observations plus prior information, unless using SVD or LSQR. MAXCOMPDIM (optional) activates compressed Jacobian matrix storage.**

### Header
**4.2.4 Third Line**

### Content
NPAR
This is the total number of parameters featured in the current PEST case, including adjustable, fixed and tied parameters; NPAR must be supplied as an integer.
NOBS
This integer variable represents the total number of observations featured in the current case. Note that, when counting the number of observations, dummy observations (see chapter 2) that may be featured in one or a number of instruction files are ignored.
NPARGP
This is the number of parameter groups. Recall from the previous chapter that the variables which govern the operation of finite-difference derivatives are assigned to parameter groups. Parameter grouping can also be of importance where the ADDREG1 utility described in part II of this manual is employed to add preferred value Tikhonov regularisation to a PEST control file. NPARGP is an integer variable.
NPRIOR
NPRIOR, another integer variable, is the number of articles of prior information that are included in the parameter estimation process. If there are no articles of prior information, NPRIOR must be zero. If PEST is running in “estimation” mode, then you should ensure that the number of adjustable parameters is less than or equal to the number of observations for which there are non-zero weights plus the number of articles of prior information for which there are non-zero weights. If this is not the case, then the inverse problem cannot possibly have a unique solution. Furthermore, unless solution of this nonunique inverse problem is sought using singular value decomposition or LSQR, PEST may make little progress in lowering the objective function because the XtQX matrix appearing in equation 5.2.9 of Doherty (2015) will be singular and hence non-invertible. Sadly, nonuniqueness is the rule rather than the exception when calibrating environmental models. PEST is not troubled by parameter nonuniqueness if Tikhonov regularisation is introduced to the inverse problem, and if singular value decomposition or LSQR is used in solution of that problem. Because of the prevalence of nonuniqueness in environmental model calibration, this should be done as a matter of course. (The outnumbering of observations by parameters does not create a numerical problem if singular value decomposition or LSQR are used to solve the inverse problem, despite the noninvertability of XtQX.)
NOBSGP
NOBSGP, another integer variable, is the number of observation groups featured in the PEST control file. Each observation and each prior information equation must be assigned to an observation group (they can all be assigned to the same group if desired). When PEST evaluates the total objective function it also evaluates the contribution made to this total by each observation group.
MAXCOMPDIM
MAXCOMPDIM is an optional integer variable. It is used to activate compressed internal storage of the Jacobian matrix by PEST. This can slow PEST execution. At the same time it can allow PEST to undertake very highly parameterized inversion wherein adjustable parameters may number in the tens of thousands. This is further discussed in section 15.4.

### Content
Although programs of the PEST++ suite read only the first variable on this line, the other variables that are featured on this line in figure 4.3 must be set to correct values to pass the scrutiny of PESTCHEK. All of these variables are integers. Their values must be greater than zero, except for NPRIOR which can be zero.
NPAR is the number of parameters featured in the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file. NOBS is the number of observations featured in the “observation data” section of a PEST control file. NPARGP is the number of parameter groups featured in the “parameter groups” section, while NPRIOR is the number of prior information equations featured in the “prior information” section of a PEST control file. The final variable on this line (NOBSGP) is the number of observation groups featured in the “observation groups” section of a PEST control file.

### Summary
**The "prior information" section contains prior information equations (≤300 characters, use "&" for continuation). Each equation starts with PILBL (≤20 characters, unique), followed by linear combinations of PIFAC*PARNME (or PIFAC*log(PARNME)), =PIVAL, WEIGHT, OBGNME.  Parameters must be adjustable; log-transformed parameters require log-based prior information.  ADDREG1 (Part II) automates prior information addition.**

### Header
**4.15 Prior Information Section**

### Content
If the value of NPRIOR provided in the “control data” section of the PEST control file is not zero, PEST expects NPRIOR articles of prior information. Prior information can be thought of as observations which pertain directly to parameters themselves. As such, they comprise part of the calibration dataset which, together with observations, assists in the estimation of parameters. An “observation” which comprises a prior information equation can involve more than one parameter. However relationships between parameters that are encapsulated in prior information equations must be linear. If parameter-constraining “observations” pertain to nonlinear relationships between parameters, these relationships must be calculated by the model itself. The PAR2PAR utility can accomplish this task; see part II of this manual.
The manner in which prior information equations are recorded in the “prior information” section of the PEST control file is not unlike that in which you would write an equation on paper yourself; however certain strict protocols must be observed. Refer to figure 4.1 for an instance of a PEST control file containing prior information. (Note that PEST utilities such as the ADDREG1 utility described in part II of this manual, as well as some of the programs comprising the Groundwater Utility suite, add prior information to a PEST control file automatically, this saving you the trouble of having to add it yourself.)
Each item on a prior information line must be separated from its neighbouring items by at least one space. Each new article of prior information must begin on a new line. No prior information line is permitted to exceed 300 characters in length; however a continuation character (“&” followed by a space at the start of a line) allows you to write a lengthy prior information equation over several successive lines.
Prior information lines must adhere to the syntax set out in figure 4.14.
PILBL PIFAC * PARNME + PIFAC * log(PARNME) ... = PIVAL WEIGHT OBGNME
(one such line for each of the NPRIOR articles of prior information)
Figure 4.14. The syntax of a prior information line.
Each prior information article must begin with a prior information label; this is the character variable PILBL in figure 4.14. Like observation names, this label must be no more than twenty characters in length, is case insensitive, and must be unique to each prior information article.
Following the prior information label is the prior information equation. To the left of the “=” sign there are one or more combinations of a factor (PIFAC) plus parameter name (PARNME), with a “log” prefix to the parameter name if appropriate. PIFAC and PARNME are separated by a “*” character (which must be separated from PIFAC and PARNME by at least one space) signifying multiplication. All parameters referenced in a prior information equation must be adjustable parameters; i.e. you must not include any fixed or tied parameters in an article of prior information. Furthermore, any particular parameter can be referenced only once in any one prior information equation; however, it can be referenced in more than one equation.
The parameter factor must never be omitted. Suppose, for example, that a prior information equation consists of only a single term, namely that an untransformed, adjustable parameter named “par1” has a preferred value of 2.305, and that you would like PEST to include this.
information in the inversion process with a weight of 1.0. If this article of prior information is given the label “pi1”, the pertinent prior information line can be written as
pi1 1.0 * par1 = 2.305 1.0 pr_info
If you had simply written
pi1 par1 = 2.305 1.0 pr_info
PEST would have objected, complaining of a syntax error.
If a parameter is log-transformed, you must provide prior information pertinent to the log of that parameter, rather than to the parameter itself. Furthermore, the parameter name must be placed in brackets and preceded by “log” (note that there is no space between “log” and the following opening bracket). Thus, in the above example, if parameter “par1” is log-transformed, the prior information article should be rewritten as
pi1 1.0 * log(par1) = .362671 1.0 pr_info
Note that logs are taken to base 10. Though not illustrated, you will also need to review the weight which you attach to this prior information equation by comparing the extent to which you would permit the log of “par1” to deviate from 0.362671 with the extent to which model-generated observations are permitted to deviate from their measured counterparts.
The left side of a prior information equation can be comprised of the sum and/or difference of a number of factor-parameter pairs of the type already illustrated; these pairs must be separated from each other by a “+” or “-” sign, with a space to either side of the sign. For example
pi2 1.0 * par2 + 3.43435 * par4 - 2.389834 * par3 = 1.09e3 3.00 group_pr
Prior information equations which include log-transformed parameters must express a relationship between the logs of those parameters. For example if you would like the ratio between the estimated values of parameters “par1” and “par2” to be about 40.0, the prior information equation may be written as
pi3 1.0 * log(par1) - 1.0 * log(par2) = 1.60206 2.0 group_pr

### Summary
**PESTPP-PSO (parallel only) uses a PEST control file (Chapter 4) and a PSO control file (specified via "++PSO(case.pso)") for multi-objective optimization (Siade et al. 2019, Coello et al. 2004). PESTPP-GLM starts agents.  PESTPP-PSO uses data from the PEST control file (Figure 11.1, shaded variables) and is compatible with PEST and its utilities.  Dummy values are needed for unused PEST variables.**

### Header
**11.1.1 General**

### Content
PESTPP-PSO was developed using the FORTRAN interface provided within the PEST++ source code. Currently, PESTPP-PSO is only designed to operate in parallel, and the command to execute the “manager” is as follows (which differs slightly from the other PEST++ calling programs),
| pestpp-pso case*.*pst port |
|----------------------------|
where, *case* represents the base name for the modeling study and *port* is the port number over which communications occur (please see previous documentation in this manual on the general usage of PEST++, e.g., Chapter 5). The main control file follows the format of a standard PEST control file (see Chapter 4). The calling program, PESTPP-PSO, will obtain most of the data regarding the optimization problem from this PEST control file. That is, it will collect some control, parameter and observation data; Figure 11.1 displays which data is actually used by PESTPP-PSO (shaded in grey). Some of this differs from most other PEST++ programs. It is important to note that PESTPP-PSO is designed to be compatible with PEST and its utilities (e.g., PESTCHEK). So, even if PESTPP-PSO is not using some of the variables listed in Figure 11.1, a dummy value must be entered in their place; this can be anything the user wants so long as it’s consistent with the format of the variable as defined by PEST (i.e., the dummy value for an integer variable should still be an integer, a character string should be a character string, etc.).
PESTPP-PSO must use another PEST++ calling program to initiate the “agents”. It is recommended that the PESTPP-GLM is used for this with the following command (see Chapter 5 for more details). In addition to the information contained in the main control file, PESTPP-PSO will need additional PSO-specific control variables. These will be contained in a separate PSO control file, which is defined by entering a line in the main control file that provides the path to the PSO specs file, and begins with the “++” identifier, i.e.,
