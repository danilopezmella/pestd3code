### Summary
**PEST uses RELPARMAX (relative change), FACPARMAX (factor change), and ABSPARMAX(N) (absolute change) to limit parameter adjustments per iteration (PARCHGLIM specifies the limit type).  These limits prevent overshooting and enhance stability.  Relative limits can severely restrict downward movement; factor limits prevent sign changes.**

### Header
**4.2.7 Sixth Line**

### Content
PEST provides three input variables which can be used to limit parameter adjustments during any iteration of the inversion process; see section 5.4.2 of Doherty (2015) for a discussion of the need for parameter adjustment limiting. These variables are named RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX and ABSPARMAX(N). The last of these is actually an array of variables.
As described in section 3.4.8 of this document, RELPARMAX is the maximum relative change that a parameter is allowed to undergo between optimisation iterations, whereas FACPARMAX is the maximum factor change that a parameter is allowed to undergo. ABSPARMAX(N) is the maximum absolute change that parameters assigned to change-group N are allowed to undergo. Any particular parameter can be subject to only one of these constraints; i.e. a particular parameter must be either relative-limited, factor-limited or absolute(N)-limited in its adjustment. Parameters are denoted as either relative-limited, factor-limited or absolute(N)-limited through the character variable PARCHGLIM associated with each parameter in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file.
The relative change in parameter b between iterations i-1 and i is defined as
(bi-1 - b )/bi-1   i
If parameter b is relative-limited, the absolute value of this relative change must be less than RELPARMAX. If a parameter upgrade vector is calculated such that the relative adjustment for one or more relative-limited parameters is greater than RELPARMAX, the magnitude of the upgrade vector is reduced such that this no longer occurs.
The factor change for parameter b between iterations i-1 and i is defined as
bi-1 /b   i        if bi-1 > b , or i
b /bi-1   i        if b  > bi-1 i
If parameter b is factor-limited, this factor change (which either equals or exceeds unity according to equation 4.2.5) must be less than FACPARMAX. If a parameter upgrade vector is calculated such that the factor adjustment for one or more factor-limited parameters is greater than FACPARMAX, the magnitude of the upgrade vector is reduced such that this no longer occurs.
The absolute change for parameter b between iterations i-1 and i is defined as
|b – bi-1| i
If parameter b is absolute-limited because PARCHGLIM for this variable has been designated as “absolute(N)” where 0 ≤ N ≤ 10, this absolute change must be less than ABSPARMAX(N). If a parameter upgrade vector is calculated such that the absolute change for one or more absolute(N)-limited parameters is greater than ABSPARMAX(N), the magnitude of the upgrade vector is reduced such that this no longer occurs.
Whether a parameter should be relative-limited, factor-limited or absolute-limited depends on the parameter. Emplacement of a relative of factor limit works well on most occasion;
Requirements for absolute parameter change limits are relatively rare. Use of a relative limit requires caution however, as a parameter can be reduced from its current value right down to zero for a relative change of only 1; as described in section 3.4.8 it may then take many iterations to re-adjust the value of the parameter upwards, introducing serious inefficiencies to the parameter estimation process. If you wish to limit the extent of its downward movement during any one iteration to less than this, you may wish to set RELPARMAX to, for example, 0.5; however this may unduly restrict its upward movement. It may be better to declare the parameter as factor-limited. If so, a FACPARMAX value of, say 5.0, would limit its downward movement on any one iteration to 0.2 of its value at the start of the iteration and its upward movement to 5 times its starting value. This may be a more sensible approach for many parameters. Alternatively, provide the parameter with a non-zero OFFSET value and adjust its upper and lower bounds such that it never becomes zero, or nearly zero.
It is important to note that a factor limit will not allow a parameter to change sign. Hence if a parameter must be free to change sign in the course of the inversion process, it must be relative-limited or absolute(N)-limited; furthermore, if it is relative-limited, RELPARMAX must be set to greater than unity or the change of sign will be impossible. Thus the PESTCHEK utility (see part II of this manual) will not allow you to declare a parameter as factor-limited, or as relative-limited with a relative limit of less than 1, if its upper and lower bounds are of opposite sign. Similarly, if a parameter’s upper or lower bound is zero, it cannot be factor-limited and RELPARMAX must be at least unity.
Suitable values for RELPARMAX and FACPARMAX vary between cases. For highly non-linear problems, these values are best set low. If they are set too low, however, the inversion process can be very slow. An inspection of the PEST run record will often reveal whether you have set these values too low, for PEST records the maximum parameter factor and relative changes on this file at the end of every iteration. If these changes are always at their upper limits and the estimation process is showing no signs of instability, it is quite possible that RELPARMAX and/or FACPARMAX could be increased (or that better regularisation be provided for insensitive parameters).

### Summary
**In unregularized, highly parameterized inversions, insensitive parameters may cause large adjustments exceeding change limits (RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, ABSPARMAX(N)), resulting in minimal objective function reduction. Increasing these limits may not solve the problem; instead, consider regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity.  The parameter sensitivity file (section 5.3.3) helps identify insensitive parameters.**

### Header
**6.2.1 Aberrant PEST Behaviour in the Absence of Regularisation**

### Content
Where many parameters are being estimated and some are far more insensitive than others, it is commonplace to encounter problems in an unregularised parameter estimation process. (Regularisation can include use of singular value decomposition or LSQR as a solution mechanism for the inverse problem, and/or the use of Tikhonov constraints.) Under these circumstances PEST, in response to the relative insensitivity of certain parameters, may calculate an upgrade vector in which these insensitive parameters are adjusted by a large amount in comparison to other, more sensitive, parameters. PEST may feel that this large adjustment of insensitive parameters is warranted if alterations to their values are to have any effect on the objective function; meanwhile the magnitude of this calculated adjustment may exceed the range of the linearity assumption on which basis it was calculated. Meanwhile the magnitude of the change that can be incurred by any parameter during any particular iteration of the parameter estimation process is limited by the values assigned to the PEST control variables RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX and/or ABSPARMAX(N). PEST reduces the magnitude (but not the direction – unless the UPVECBEND control variable is set to 1) of the parameter upgrade vector such that no parameter undergoes a change that exceeds these limits. Unfortunately, if a particular insensitive parameter dominates the parameter upgrade vector, then restricting the magnitude of this vector such that the change in the value of the insensitive parameter is limited to RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX or ABSPARMAX(N) (depending on its PARCHGLIM setting) results in much smaller changes to other, more sensitive, parameters. Hence, the objective function may be reduced very little (if at all).
Under these circumstances, increasing RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX and/or ABSPARMAX(N) is not necessarily the solution to the problem, for parameter change limits are necessary to avoid unstable behaviour in the face of problem nonlinearity.
In normal PEST usage the occurrence of this problem is easily recognised by the fact that the maximum relative, factor or absolute parameter changes for a particular iteration (as printed to the screen and to the run record file) are equal to RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX or ABSPARMAX(N) respectively, and that the objective function is reduced very little. PEST records the names of parameters that have undergone the largest relative, factor and (where applicable) absolute changes at the end of all of its iterations. More often than not, an inspection of the parameter sensitivity file (see section 5.3.3) reveals that these same

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Chapter 6 discusses automatic user intervention in PEST for regularization methods in parameter estimation. It suggests identifying and temporarily fixing insensitive parameters to improve matrix condition number and objective function. Parameters like DOAUI and MAXAUI customize intervention behavior, with options for mitigating bad derivatives and improving sensitivity.
- **Detailed Summary:** In unregularized inversions, insensitive parameters can lead to large adjustments beyond set limits, resulting in minimal objective function improvement. Increasing limits may not help; regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity is recommended. Use the parameter sensitivity file to identify insensitive parameters and consider temporarily holding them at current values using the case.hld file.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Automatic user intervention (Chapter 6) is largely unnecessary with modern regularization methods but is retained for difficult cases or derivative mitigation (section 6.4).  Most users can ignore this chapter.
- **Next Summary:** Regularization best addresses problems caused by insensitive parameters in unregularized inversions. Alternatively, temporarily holding troublesome parameters (identified via the parameter sensitivity file) at their current values, may allow the objective function to improve.  This process may need to be repeated for multiple parameters.

### Summary
**RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX (≥1.0), and FACORIG (often 0.001) in the "control data" section limit parameter changes per iteration in PESTPP-GLM to prevent overshooting and oscillations.  RELPARMAX < 1.0 is allowed only if bounds are not of opposite sign.  Default values of 10.0 are often suitable.**

### Header
**4.6.7 Sixth Line**

### Content
This line contains the three real-valued variables, RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX and FACORIG. As is discussed in section 3.2.5 of this manual, these are used by PESTPP-GLM to limit the change that any parameter can undergo during any iteration of an inversion process. Where a model is highly nonlinear, and where adjustments to parameter values are calculated using local gradients (i.e., using a Jacobian matrix that is based on current parameter values), the calculated amounts by which parameters should change in order to accrue a reduction in an objective function may actually cause the objective function to rise because of large changes in the objective function gradient along the trajectory of parameter adjustment. Use of these control variables to limit the change that any parameter can undergo during any iteration of an inversion process can safeguard that process from severe oscillations caused by successive parameter over-adjustment and ensuing over-compensation. All parameters are subject to a change limit. The length of the overall parameter adjustment vector is reduced (but its direction is not changed) to ensure that these limits are respected.
Values of 10.0 are often suitable for both RELPARMAX and FACPARMAX. Note, however, that FACPARMAX can never be less than 1.0; RELPARMAX can be less than 1.0 as long as no parameter’s upper and lower bounds are of opposite sign. PESTCHEK will inform you if you get this wrong.
A suitable value for FACORIG is 0.001. See section 3.2.5 for further details.

### Summary
**In PESTPP-OPT, parameter groups define decision variables (*opt_dec_var_groups*) and model parameters.  *opt_external_dev_var_groups* (subset of *opt_dec_var_groups*) specifies external decision variables (requiring template files).  Finite-difference derivatives (using parameter group settings) may be needed for calculating the response matrix. Decision variables cannot be log-transformed but can be tied or fixed;  FACPARMAX and RELPARMAX limits do not apply.**

### Header
**8.2.2 Decision Variables and Parameters**

### Content
In a PEST control file, each parameter is assigned to a parameter group. PEST control variables which govern the operation of finite difference derivatives are assigned to these groups. These variables are just as important for PESTPP-OPT as they are for other members of the PEST++ suite (and indeed PEST), as PESTPP-OPT may be required to calculate multiple Jacobian and response matrices using finite parameter differences.
However, for PESTPP-OPT, parameter groups play another important role. They provide the means through which entities defined in the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file are separated into decision variables on the one hand and model parameters on the other hand. The former are adjusted through the constrained optimization process that is implemented by PESTPP-OPT. The latter are used in calculation of the uncertainties of model outputs to which optimization constraints are applied; however, they are not actually adjusted.
The PEST++ control variable *opt_dec_var_groups()* informs PESTPP-OPT of the names of parameter groups whose members comprise decision variables. A comma-delimited list of parameter group names must be supplied as the value of this control variable. If this variable is omitted from the PEST control file, then PESTPP-OPT assumes that all parameter groups are comprised of decision variables (and hence that there is no uncertainty associated with any model output).
It is by no means essential that every decision-variable be a model input. As will be discussed below, PESTPP-OPT allows arbitrary designation of the objective function defined by equation 8.4. All that is required is that all “parameters” that are used in calculation of the objective function belong to parameter groups that are nominated as containing decision variables. It is good practice to place decision variables which are not used by the model into different groups from those which influence model behaviour. The former are denoted herein as “external” decision variables. Then, when it fills the management response matrix (i.e., the A matrix of equation 8.5), PESTPP-OPT knows that it does not need to run the model to calculate finite-difference derivatives with respect to these decision variables.
The names of parameter groups which house external decision variables can be supplied through the *opt_external_dev_var_groups()* control variable. The value of this variable is a comma-delimited list of the names of parameter groups which hold external decision variables. Parameter groups whose names are supplied through the *opt_external_dev_var_groups()* keyword must also be supplied through the *opt_dec_var_groups()* keyword; the former are a subset of the latter. It is also important to note that, for the sake of PEST++ protocol consistency, all external parameters must appear in a template file, despite the fact that they are not used by the model. This can be easily accomplished by including their names in a single template file which can be matched (in the “model input” section of the PEST control file) to a model input file which the model never actually reads.
The simplex algorithm that PESTPP-OPT employs to minimize the objective function defined by equation 8.4 is quite different from that used by PEST and PESTPP-GLM to minimize the type of objective function that quantifies model-to-measurement misfit. Hence some of the control variables that are pertinent to the latter optimization process are not pertinent to the former process. In particular, decision variables that are adjusted by PESTPP-OPT cannot be log-transformed; however, they can be tied or fixed. As they are altered in order to minimize the management objective function, they are not subject to limits imposed by the FACPARMAX and RELPARMAX variables that are featured in the “control data” section of the PEST control file.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST optimizes predictions while maintaining the objective function below a threshold, considering post-calibration uncertainty. It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction (in the "predict" group) while keeping the objective function ≤ Φ0 (requires a prior "estimation" run).  It uses the same parameters, transformations, and observations as the estimation run.  Restarting uses `/r`, `/j`, `/d`, or `/s` (parallel runs).  Change limits remain important.  Screen output shows prediction values per iteration.  Results include the optimal prediction and parameter values.

- **Next Summary:** *opt_obj_func* (prior information equation, file—Figure 8.1, or observation) defines PESTPP-OPT's objective function (Equation 8.4). *opt_direction* ("min" or "max") sets optimization direction.  If *opt_obj_func* is absent, coefficients default to 1.0.  The file must list all decision variables and their coefficients (space, tab, or comma-delimited; comment lines are ignored).

### Summary
**RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX (~10.0 unless highly nonlinear), and ABSPARMAX(N) limit parameter changes.  FACORIG prevents very small parameters from overly restricting adjustments. IBOUNDSTICK (0 or n iterations) "glues" parameters at bounds after n iterations; a value of 2-4 is suggested but generally inadvisable.**

### Header
**4.2.7 Sixth Line**

### Content
If you are unsure of how to set these parameters, a value of 10.0 for each of them is often suitable. In cases of extreme nonlinearity, be prepared to set them lower, however. But note that FACPARMAX can never be less than 1; RELPARMAX can be less than 1 as long as no parameter’s upper and lower bounds are of opposite sign.
The best value for ABSPARMAX(N) is context specific; hence no general advice can be provided on assigning a value to this variable. If no parameters are designated as absolute(N)-limited in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file, then ABSPARMAX(N) does not need to feature on the sixth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. If supplied, it is written as “absparmax(n) = value”. This string can be placed anywhere on this line; however it is recommended that it follow FACORIG. Three absolute limits feature in the following example of line 6 of the “control data” section of a PEST control file.

PEST iteration.
FACORIG
If, in the course of the inversion process, a parameter becomes very small, the relative or factor limit to subsequent adjustment of this parameter may severely hamper its growth back to higher values, resulting in very slow convergence to an objective function minimum. Furthermore, for the case of relative-limited parameters which are permitted to change sign, it is possible that the denominator of equation 4.2.4 could become zero.
To obviate these possibilities, choose a suitable value for the real variable, FACORIG. If the absolute value of a parameter falls below FACORIG times its original value, then FACORIG times its original value is substituted for the denominator of equation 4.2.4. For factor-limited parameters, a similar modification is introduced to equation 4.2.5. Thus the constraints that apply to a growth in absolute value of a parameter are lifted when its absolute value has become less than FACORIG times its original absolute value. However, where PEST wishes to reduce the parameter’s absolute value even further, factor-limitations are not lifted; nor are relative limitations lifted if RELPARMAX is less than 1. FACORIG is not used to adjust limits for log-transformed parameters.
FACORIG must be greater than zero. A value of 0.001 is often suitable.
IBOUNDSTICK
Operation of the IBOUNDSTICK variable is described in section 3.4.5 of this manual. It can be used to reduce the number of model runs required per iteration by permanently freezing at their bounds parameters which have encountered their bounds and seem reluctant to move from there. If IBOUNDSTICK is supplied as zero, or omitted altogether, PEST’s handling of bounds is unchanged from its normal operation as described in section 3.4.4. However if it is set to n (where n is a positive integer), PEST will permanently “glue” a parameter to its upper or lower bound if that parameter has resided there for n optimisation iterations. Once a parameter is “glued” to one of its bounds it will never move again, for PEST will no longer include this parameter in its upgrade vector calculations. Nor will it calculate derivatives with respect to this parameter, thus reducing the number of model runs required per iteration.
You should carefully note the following points regarding the use of IBOUNDSTICK.
1. If IBOUNDSTICK is set to 1, then parameters will be glued to their bounds from the moment that they strike them (beginning at the iteration immediately following the bounds encounter). Thus if the initial value of a parameter is at its upper bound and IBOUNDSTICK is set to 1, then the parameter will be glued to its bound from the very first iteration.
2. If IBOUNDSTICK is set to 2, then 1 complete iteration will elapse (in which the parameter is free to move back into allowed parameter space) since the iteration at which it encountered its bound before that parameter is glued to its bound.
If used, a good setting for IBOUNDSTICK is 2 to 4. However experience has shown that use of the IBOUNDSTICK variable is generally not advisable. Hence it should normally be omitted or set to zero. This is because, for nonlinear models, the sensitivities of parameters can depend not just on their own values, but on those of others. Hence a parameter may have a propensity to reside at its bound during certain stages of the inversion process but not at other stages. Another problem with use of bounds sticking functionality, is that PEST loses the capacity to calculate statistics such as composite sensitivities and the post-calibration.
parameter covariance matrix. Furthermore the derivative of the parameter is not included in the Jacobian matrix file. Hence the Jacobian matrix must be re-computed before linear analysis utilities described in part II of this manual can be used. These problems can be overcome by adopting the following procedure on completion of a PEST run in which bounds sticking is activated.
