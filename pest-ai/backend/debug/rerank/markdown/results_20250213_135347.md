ICOV, ICOR and IEIG
If PEST is run in “estimation” mode, and if neither singular value decomposition nor LSQR is employed in solution of the inverse problem, then at the end of each iteration of the inversion process PEST can write a “matrix file” containing linear estimates of the posterior covariance and correlation coefficient matrices, as well as eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the posterior covariance matrix. Calculation of these matrices is based on the current Jacobian matrix. Settings of the ICOV, ICOR and IEIG variables determine which (if any) of these data are recorded in the matrix file. A setting of 1 for each of these variables will result in the corresponding information being recorded. On the other hand, a setting of 0 will result in the corresponding information not being recorded. Regardless of these settings, all of these matrices are recorded on the run record file at the end of the inversion process (provided, once again, that PEST is not run in “regularisation” mode and that neither singular value decomposition nor LSQR is used to solve the inverse problem.)
The posterior covariance matrix, together with its correlation coefficients and eigenvectors/eigenvalues, can be used to examine the “health” of an inverse problem in which regularisation is purely manual and therefore implied in the definition of the parameters themselves. This covariance matrix is computed using equation 5.2.13 of Doherty (2015). Note, however, that these matrices cannot be computed if an inverse problem is completely ill-posed.
A better way to compute a posterior covariance matrix is to use the PREDUNC7 utility; this is not troubled by problem ill-posedness. Other linear parameter and predictive uncertainty analysis possibilities are available through utilities discussed in part II of this manual. Furthermore, with mathematical regularisation in place, the information provided by eigenvector decomposition of the posterior covariance matrix, and by parameter correlation coefficients computed from this matrix, is not really needed, for the mathematical regularisation process, instead of the user, takes care of possible inverse problem ill-posedness. See Doherty (2015) for details.
IRES
This is an integer variable which controls the writing of a “resolution data file”. This is a binary file which is used by utilities such as RESPROC, RESWRIT and PARAMERR which compute the resolution matrix, and quantify post-calibration predictive error variance. The resolution data file is automatically named case.rsd, where case is the filename base of the PEST control file.
If omitted, IRES is set to 1. Writing of a resolution data file can therefore only be prevented if IRES is included in the PEST control file and specifically set to 0. This is its recommended setting, as the utility programs which use it are less informative than more recent programs such as those comprising the PREDVAR* and PREDUNC* suites which have superseded them; the latter programs do not read a resolution data file.
JCOSAVE
This optional text variable can be used to suppress recording of the binary Jacobian matrix file (i.e. JCO file). If supplied, it must be provided as “jcosave” or “nojcosave”. If omitted,
“jcosave” prevails. This variable can be placed anywhere following the mandatory IEIG or optional IRES variable on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file. Its recommended value is “jcosave”, unless the inverse problem size is very large indeed and the MAXCOMPDIM variable has been employed to activate internal compressed Jacobian matrix storage; in the latter case the accessing of a large Jacobian matrix for the purpose of recording a JCO file can be computationally intensive.
JCOSAVEITN
JCOSAVEITN is an optional character variable which should be supplied as either “jcosaveitn” or “nojcosaveitn”. If the former string is supplied, PEST writes a JCO file at the end of every iteration, this containing the Jacobian matrix calculated during that iteration. The name of each such file is case.jco.N where N is the iteration number to which the JCO file pertains. Alternatively, if JCOSAVEITN is set to “nojcosaveitn”, or omitted altogether, PEST will not save a progression of JCO files in this manner. Note that the JCO file containing the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the best parameter set attained so far is saved to a file named case.jco in the usual manner, regardless of the setting of JCOSAVEITN. The JCOSAVEITN variable can be placed anywhere on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file following ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and, optionally, IRES. JCOSAVEITN should be set to “jcosaveitn” if it is desired that the MULJCOSEN utility be employed for monitoring of changes to composite parameter and/or observation sensitivities during the inversion process. See part II of this manual for a description of this utility.
VERBOSEREC
Where parameter, observation and prior information numbers are high, the PEST run record file becomes voluminous - so voluminous that it is almost impossible for a user to obtain useful information from it. PEST will write a much shorter run record file if VERBOSEREC (a text variable) is set to “noverboserec”. The default value for this variable (i.e. the value that will prevail if it is not supplied at all) is “verboserec”. The VERBOSEREC variable can be placed anywhere following ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and, optionally, IRES on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file.

### Summary
**EIGPROC summarizes information from case.rec and case.sen files.  It requires PESTMODE="estimation", ICOV=ICOR=IEIG=1,  a completed or "stop with statistics" run, and a well-posed problem (invertible JtQJ matrix). Use `eigproc case`.**

### Header
**8.2.1 General**

### Content
EIGPROC reads a PEST run record file and a PEST sensitivity file. It extracts and summarises information from these files. Recall that a PEST run record file is always named case.rec where case is the filename base of the PEST control file; a sensitivity file is named case.sen.
Use of EIGPROC (which stands for “eigenstuff processor”) is predicated on the following assumptions.
- PEST has been run in “estimation” mode.
- The ICOV, ICOR and IEIG variables in the “control data” section of the PEST control file are all set to 1.
- PEST has run to completion, or has been stopped using the “stop with statistics option”. (This will happen if the PSTOPST program has been run in another window).
- The parameter estimation problem is well posed so that the JtQJ matrix (often referred to as the “normal matrix”) inverted by PEST to obtain the parameter covariance matrix is not singular; thus a post‑calibration covariance matrix (and associated correlation coefficient and eigendata matrices) are recorded at the end of the run record file.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST optimizes predictions while maintaining the objective function below a threshold, considering post-calibration uncertainty. It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction (in the "predict" group) while keeping the objective function ≤ Φ0 (requires a prior "estimation" run).  It uses the same parameters, transformations, and observations as the estimation run.  Restarting uses `/r`, `/j`, `/d`, or `/s` (parallel runs).  Change limits remain important.  Screen output shows prediction values per iteration.  Results include the optimal prediction and parameter values.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** This chapter details post-PEST run utilities analyzing calibration dataset information content and parameter estimability.  Some utilities (EIGPROC, PCOV2MAT, INFSTAT, INFSTAT1) are for well-posed problems; others (SUPCALC, IDENTPAR, SSSTAT) handle ill-posed problems.  GENLINPRED (analyzes prediction uncertainties, separate chapter) provides further insights.
- **Next Summary:** EIGPROC analyzes the parameter covariance matrix from a PEST run record file (case.rec) and sensitivity file (case.sen), requiring a well-posed "estimation" mode run (ICOV=ICOR=IEIG=1). Use `eigproc case N exlim outfile`: case specifies the control file, N is the number of eigenvalues, exlim is the eigenvector component threshold, and outfile is the output file.  Output includes eigenvalues, eigenvectors (components >exlim), sensitivities, and a correlation coefficient submatrix.

- **Previous Summary:** NOPTMAX (integer, 50 recommended) sets maximum iterations; 0 runs one model; -1 or -2 generates a JCO file.  PESTPP-GLM uses PHIREDSTP (real, 0.005), NPHISTP (integer, 4), NPHINORED (integer, 4), RELPARSTP (real, 0.005), and NRELPAR (integer, 4) for termination; PESTPP-IES uses all except RELPARSTP and NRELPAR. Other PEST++ programs use only NOPTMAX.
- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-GLM uses SVD for inversion, with settings overridable via a "singular value decomposition" section (MAXSING, EIGTHRESH). MAXSING directly sets dimensionality; EIGTHRESH sets it implicitly (ratio of squared singular values of Q½J).  Omit this section to use PESTPP-GLM defaults.  MAXSING should equal or exceed the number of parameters unless dimensionality reduction is desired.  *max_n_super*/ *super_eigthresh* (PEST++) control super parameter numbers in SVD-assisted inversion;  MAXSING/EIGTHRESH control SVD regardless of base/super parameter estimation.  PESTPP-IES and PESTPP-DA also use internal SVD defaults, which are overridden if the "singular value decomposition" section is present.

### Summary
**case.rei (interim residuals file) contains observation names, groups, measured and modeled values, residuals, and weights (or "Cov. Mat.") per iteration.  case.mtt (matrix file) contains covariance, correlation, eigenvector, and eigenvalue matrices (if ICOV, ICOR, IEIG=1, no regularization, JtQJ invertible).  The condition number file (JtQJ + λI) is created if SVD or LSQR are not used.  REISAVEITN saves multiple case.rei files.**

### Header
**4.19.2 Format of a Covariance Matrix File**

### Content
Because a new set of “rotated observations” is calculated for members of this group, the user-assigned names for the original observations are no longer applicable. Hence when PEST lists the names of the new observations to this file, it formulates new observation names by adding the string “_r” to the names of the original observations. However it is important to note that a rotated observation whose name is formulated by adding the string “_r” to the name of an original observation has no more of a direct relationship to that original observation than it does to any other member of the original observation group; this observation naming convention is just a convenience.
5.3.6 Interim Residuals File
At the beginning of each iteration PEST writes a file named case.rei where case is the filename base of the PEST control file. This file is a “temporary” or “interim” residuals file. It contains six columns of data. The first two columns cite observation names and group names; then follow observation values (supplied by the user) and their current model-generated counterparts. Current residuals and weights follow that in subsequent columns.
The following should be noted.
1. Model-generated observations recorded in the residuals file pertain to the best parameters calculated at the stage of the parameter estimation process at which the interim residuals file is written.
2. If an observation belongs to a group for which a covariance matrix is supplied, then a weight cannot be assigned to it. Hence, in accordance with the convention adopted for the residuals file case.res recorded at the end of the parameter estimation process, the string “Cov. Mat” is recorded in place of a weight.
3. As is explained in chapter 9 of this manual, weights pertaining to members of regularisation groups change throughout the inversion process. Hence these weights are different for different case.rei files recorded at different stages of a regularised inversion process.
5.3.7 The Matrix File
During each iteration, just after it has calculated the Jacobian matrix, PEST calculates the “post-calibration” covariance and correlation coefficient matrices, as well as the eigenvalues.
and normalised eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, for the current set of parameter values. However this only happens if the following conditions are met.
- ICOV, ICOR and IEIG are set to 1 in the “control data” section of the PEST control file;
- No form or regularisation is employed (as the use regularisation renders these matrices meaningless); hence neither singular value decomposition nor LSQR is used to solve the inverse problem, and Tikhonov regularisation is not employed;
- The matrix JtQJ is invertible, where J is the Jacobian matrix and Q is the weight matrix.
These matrices are written to a special file named a “matrix file”. This file is named case.mtt where case is the current case name (i.e. the filename base of the PEST control file). Each time this file is written the previous file of the same name is overwritten. Hence the matrices contained in the matrix file pertain to the most recent iteration.
If any of ICOV, ICOR or IEIG are set to zero, the corresponding matrix is not recorded in the matrix file. If they are all set to zero, then no matrices are written to this file. If ICOV is set to 1 then, as well as recording the covariance matrix to the matrix file, PEST records current parameter values and standard deviations. (The standard deviation of a parameter is the square root of its variance; parameter variances comprise the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.) As with the elements of the covariance and associated matrices, the standard deviation of a parameter actually pertains to the log of that parameter if the parameter is log-transformed during the parameter estimation process.
The observant PEST user may notice slight differences between the matrices recorded in the final matrix file and those recorded in the run record file at the end of the PEST run. If the lowest objective function achieved during the parameter estimation process was calculated by PEST during its final iteration, then you may expect that these two sets of matrices will be very similar. Nevertheless, there are often differences between them. These differences result from the fact that the reference variance (see equation 5.3.3) used in calculation of matrices which are recorded in the matrix file is computed using the objective function calculated at the end of the previous iteration, whereas for the covariance and related matrices recorded in the run record file, the best objective function calculated during the whole parameter estimation process is used in computing the reference variance. If the best objective function was computed on the final parameter upgrade, this will differ slightly from that calculated at the beginning of the last iteration.
5.3.8 The Condition Number File
Unless PEST is using singular value decomposition or LSQR for solution of the inverse problem, it writes the condition number of the matrix which it must invert to calculate parameter upgrades (i.e. JtQJ + λI) to a “condition number file”. The condition number is recorded for every Marquardt lambda tested during every PEST iteration.

### Summary
**REISAVEITN ("reisaveitn" or "noreisaveitn") controls saving interim residuals files (case.rei, case.rei.N).

An optional "singular value decomposition" section is recommended for most applications.**

### Header
**4.2.10 Ninth Line**

### Content
As is documented in the next section, PEST writes an “interim residuals file” at the end of every iteration. This file records observations and corresponding model outputs computed using the best parameters achieved in the inversion process up to that iteration. Regardless of the setting of REISAVEITN, this file is saved (and the previous one overwritten) at the end of every iteration; its name is case.rei where case is the filename base of the PEST control file. If the text variable REISAVEITN is set to “reisaveitn”, then this same file is also saved as case.rei.N where N is the current iteration number. Thus at the end of the inversion process, a sequence of files remains in the PEST working directory which collectively document the history of model-to-measurement misfit for every observation comprising the PEST input dataset. The REISAVEITN variable can be placed anywhere following ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and the optional IRES variable on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
PARSAVEITN and PARSAVERUN
If supplied, the optional “PARSAVEITN” variable must be recorded as either “parsaveitn” or “noparsaveitn”. In the former case PEST will save a parameter value file at the end of every iteration of the inversion process, this containing best parameter values achieved during that iteration, irrespective of whether they improved the overall objective function or not. This file is named case.par.N where case is the filename base of the PEST control file and N is the iteration number. A “parameter history” of the inversion process is thus recorded. Alternatively, if PARSAVEITN is set to “noparsaveitn” or omitted altogether, an iteration-specific parameter value file is not recorded. Neither option interferes with PEST’s normal behaviour of recording and refreshing a parameter value file (named case.par) containing best parameters achieved to date at the end of every iteration. See chapter 5 for further discussion of this file.
In a similar vein, the variable PARSAVERUN can be used to instruct PEST to record run-specific parameter value files. At the time of writing this functionality is only available if PEST is run as BEOPEST. PARSAVERUN must be set to “parsaverun” or “noparsaverun”; the latter is assumed if it is omitted from the PEST control file.
If PARSAVERUN is set to “parsaverun” then PEST creates a series of parameter value files named case.par.N_M where N is the run packet index and M is the run number within that packet. For identification purposes, run packet indices are also recorded on the run management record file. This file also records run numbers and the nodes to which runs were allocated. Hence a user can associate parameter values with the runs performed by different nodes involved in PEST parallelisation.
Note that if PARSAVERUN is set to “parsaverun” the number of parameter value files that are thereby recorded may be very large indeed.
The PARSAVEITN and PARSAVERUN variables can be placed anywhere following ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and the optional IRES variable on the ninth line of the “control data” section of the PEST control file.
Sensitivity Reuse Section
PEST’s sensitivity reuse functionality, as well as the contents of the “sensitivity reuse” section of the PEST control file, are described in chapter 7 of this manual. This section is optional. It does not need to be supplied if sensitivity reuse is not implemented. Even if it is implemented, (through setting the DOSENREUSE variable in the “control data” section of the PEST control file to “dosenreuse”), this section can be omitted. Under these circumstances PEST uses default values for all variables which govern implementation of sensitivity reuse functionality.
Singular Value Decomposition Section
General
Singular value decomposition (i.e. SVD) as a regularisation device, and as a means of introducing numerical stability to solution of an ill-posed inverse problem, is discussed at length in Doherty (2015). The reader is referred to that book for details. There is really no good reason not to use singular value decomposition as a matter of course.
in solving an inverse problem. If a problem is ill-posed then numerical stability of its solution is still guaranteed. Meanwhile, complementary use of Tikhonov regularisation can guarantee sensibility of estimated parameter fields. Hence a “singular value decomposition” section (or an LSQR section) should appear in most, if not all, PEST control files (except when PEST is run in “predictive analysis” mode, where the constrained predictive maximisation/minimisation process that is implemented in this mode is better served by using PEST’s default solver).
Variables appearing in the “singular value decomposition” section of the PEST control file are shown in figure 4.5. They are now described in detail.
