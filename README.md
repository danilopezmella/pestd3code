# Welcome to **PestD3code**

**PestD3code** is a VS Code extension designed to enhance the readability and usability of PEST control files for MODFLOW. This extension provides structured decorators, diagnostics, and hover support to make the interpretation and editing of `.pst` files easier and more intuitive.

### üö® **IMPORTANT NOTE** üö®

The **most important feature** of this extension is that it works **WITHOUT** modifying your `.pst` file. It functions as a seamless decorator, ensuring that your original file remains untouched. You can confidently explore and interact with your `.pst` file, knowing it stays completely safe.
