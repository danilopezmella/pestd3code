Welcome to **PestD3code**, a VS Code extension designed to enhance the readability and usability of PEST control files for MODFLOW. This extension helps users by adding structured decorators and hover support for better interpretation and editing of .pst and .pest files.

## Features

### üé® Visual Enhancements

- **Hover Tooltips:**
  - Provides detailed descriptions of PEST control variables with Markdown-formatted tooltips.
  - Includes variable descriptions, types, allowed values, and whether the variable is mandatory.
  - Specific colors for sections, floats, strings, and integers for easy visualization.

- **Collapsible Sections:**
  - Users can now collapse or expand sections of the PEST control file for easier navigation and organization.

- **Outline Panel Integration:**
  - Navigate through the file effortlessly using the Outline panel with icons for each section.

### üìÇ File Interaction

- **Clickable File Paths:**
  - File paths in the **Model Input/Output** and **Model Command Line** sections are now clickable.
  - Clicking a file path opens the file in the system's default editor (if the file exists).
  - If the file does not exist, the extension notifies the user to help identify missing or incorrect paths.

### üìñ Quick Access to PEST Manual

- A quick link to the PEST manual is now included in the first line of the file, opening the manual in a parallel window for easy reference.

### üìù Section Descriptions

- **Parameter Group Descriptions:**
  - Provides hover descriptions for the **Parameter Groups** section, explaining group-specific settings and options.

- **Parameter Data, Observation Group, and Observation Data Values:**
  - Brief explanations of values in each section.
  - Hover over each section of these parameters for the code value.

### üß© Pest++ Instructions

- **Hover Tooltips for Pest++ Attributes:**
  - Hover over Pest++ attributes to see code for each variable and description.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code:** Version 1.95.0 or later.

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or download the .vsix file.
2. Open a workspace containing .pst or .pest files.
3. Use folding to collapse or expand individual sections of the file for easier navigation and organization.
4. Hover over any PEST **Control data**, **Singular value decomposition**, **Parameter Groups**, **Parameter Data**, **Observation Groups**, **Observation Data** and **PEST++** sections to see detailed information.
5. Click on file paths in the **Model Input/Output** and **Model Command Line** sections to open them in your default editor. If the file does not exist, you will be notified.
6. Access the PEST manual quickly by clicking the link included in the first line of the file. The manual opens in a parallel window.
