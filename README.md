# Welcome to **PestD3code**

**PestD3code** is a VS Code extension designed to enhance the readability and usability of PEST control files for MODFLOW. This extension provides structured decorators and hover support to make the interpretation and editing of `.pst` and `.pest` files easier and more intuitive.

---

### üö® **IMPORTANT NOTE** üö®

The **most important feature** of this extension is that it works **WITHOUT** modifying your `.pst` file. It functions as a seamless decorator, ensuring that your original file remains untouched. You can confidently explore and interact with your `.pst` file, knowing it stays completely safe.
